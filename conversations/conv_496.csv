1,Can you explain how PrEP works and its importance in preventing HIV?,"PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a preventive medication for individuals at higher risk of contracting HIV. It works by using antiretroviral drugs to reduce the risk of HIV infection when taken consistently. There are two main forms: oral PrEP, taken daily, and injectable PrEP, administered as an injection every two months.

It empowers individuals to take control of their sexual health. If you're feeling anxious about discussing PrEP with healthcare providers, remember that they are there to help you, and seeking support from professionals can make a positive difference.",English,0
