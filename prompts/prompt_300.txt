**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling nervous about your sexual health after hearing mixed messages about HIV prevention in your community. As a bisexual non-binary person with a high income, you want to ensure you make informed choices, especially about PrEP, but you’re frustrated by the limited access to information and resources.

**Opening Question:** You should start by asking: "how do i get PrEP? like, is it easy to find here?"

**Follow-Up Guidance:** As the conversation progresses, you might ask about local clinics that provide PrEP or if there are any online resources that can help you understand the process better. You could also express your concerns about stigma in your area and how that affects your access to care. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
