**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re sitting in a small, dimly lit room, feeling anxious about your health and the rising costs of insurance. Your mind races with questions about HIV prevention, especially since you want to ensure your partner stays safe, but you're frustrated by the lack of information available to you.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me if PrEP is covered by insurance? I'm worried itâ€™s too expensive for meðŸ’”."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** what the process is for getting a prescription for PrEP and if there are any other affordable options available. You might also want to express your fears about side effects and how they might affect your life.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
