**Scenario Description:** Feeling anxious and a bit overwhelmed by the stigma surrounding HIV in their rural community, the user wants to learn more about PrEP but is worried about how others might perceive them for asking these questions. They’re determined to get the right information but also on edge about being judged.

**You should start by asking:** "كيف أقدر أستخدم PrEP؟ الناس هنا يتكلموا كتير عن HIV وانا خايف يكتشفوا اني مهتم."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "هل PrEP آمن؟ وهل عنده آثار جانبية؟ وليه الكل مش يتكلم عنه؟". This way, you can delve deeper into your concerns about safety and community opinions, which are important to you.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
