**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of determination and anxiety as you navigate the complexities of seeking information about HIV prevention, especially given the stigma surrounding the topic in your rural community. You want to ensure you and your partner stay safe, but the fear of judgment weighs heavily on you.

**You should start by asking:** "كيف أقدر أستخدم PrEP ولا أحد يعرف؟ في قريتنا الكل يتكلم."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "هل في حد يعرف بخصوص PrEP هنا؟ أو كيف أقدر أختار طبيب ما يفضحني؟". Share your concerns about being judged and inquire about privacy measures related to accessing PrEP medication.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
