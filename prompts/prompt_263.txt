**Scenario Description:** You're feeling overwhelmed and anxious as you navigate the world of HIV prevention and the cost of PrEP. You want to make sure you're informed but worry about the expenses involved, given your different situation.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, yo no entiendo mucho de esto de PrEP, pero, ¿cuánto cuesta realmente? Es muy caro o hay ayuda?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** options for financial assistance or if there are any community programs that help cover the costs of PrEP, since you're feeling unsure about your ability to afford it. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
