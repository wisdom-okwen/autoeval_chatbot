In a small rural town in China, a senior woman of Russian descent is feeling confused and anxious about her health, particularly regarding HIV prevention and PrEP, after hearing mixed messages from friends and family. She is grappling with the idea of trusting a doctor, especially since her financial situation limits her options.

You should start by asking: "how to no if doctor is good for HIV stuff? i hear diffrent things, who to trust?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the specific concerns you have regarding the effectiveness of PrEP, or whether there are low-cost clinics that can help you. Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
