**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your small apartment in Nairobi, feeling frustrated and anxious about how people in your community might react to your interest in HIV prevention and PrEP. The stigma surrounding HIV in your neighborhood weighs heavily on your mind, and you're eager to find clear answers without judgment.

**You should start by asking:** "Yo, can I ask u why people be so scared of talking about HIV? Like, what’s PrEP actually do?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "But like, if I wanna get on PrEP, what folks gon' say? Is it easy to get? Will it make peeps think I'm sick or sumthin?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
