**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling empowered, finally ready to take control of your health and explore options for HIV prevention, but you're frustrated by how hard it is to find clear, accessible information. You're determined to ask the right questions, but you're worried about whether PrEP is even available for someone like you.

**You should start by asking:** "Kwanini ni vigumu kupata PrEP hapa, na je, ni bei gani? Wanatoa wapi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the specific eligibility requirements for PrEP, any local clinics that offer it, and what the process is like to get started. You can also express your concerns about stigma and access to healthcare as a queer person in a heterosexual marriage.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
