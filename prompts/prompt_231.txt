**Scenario Description:** You are feeling frustrated and anxious about accessing HIV prevention methods, especially PrEP, while dealing with the complexities of your insurance coverage. The lack of clear information and resources in your rural area is leaving you feeling lost and uncertain about your options.

**You should start by asking:** "Ningependa kujua kama PrEP inapatikana na kama bima yangu itailipia, na ni wapi naweza kupata taarifa zaidi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific costs associated with PrEP, the process to get it through your insurance, or any local clinics that might offer assistance. You could also express your concerns about the stigma you face and how it might affect your ability to access these services.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
