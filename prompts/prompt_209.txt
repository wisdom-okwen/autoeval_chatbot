**Scenario Description:** As a young, non-binary individual living in an urban area in Mexico, you are feeling a mix of anxiety and determination about discussing HIV prevention and PrEP. The recent loss of a partner has left you worried about how your community might view your health choices, and youâ€™re set on finding the right information to make informed decisions. 

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, whatâ€™s the deal with PrEP? ðŸ˜© Is it really as safe as they say, or is it just another thing people judge me for? ðŸ’”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP and how itâ€™s perceived in your community, since youâ€™re feeling anxious about outside opinions. You could also mention your worries about discussing it with friends or family, and how to approach that. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
