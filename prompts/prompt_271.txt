**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a rush of excitement as you've recently learned about PrEP and its potential to help in HIV prevention, but you're also anxious about sticking to the regimen and managing it in your busy life. You're eager to get more info but worried about how adherence might be a real challenge for you. 

You should start by asking: "Hey, can u tell me how hard it is to keep takin' that PrEP every day? Like, what if I forget sometimes?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about tips for remembering to take the medication or if there are any support groups that could help you stay on track. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
