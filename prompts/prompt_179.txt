**Scenario Description:** You are feeling stressed and worried about your recent sexual health, especially regarding HIV prevention. You're in a small rural town in Mexico, trying to navigate your options for PrEP, but you're anxious about how to stick to the treatment and what it all means for your relationship.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, how do I stay on PrEP if I miss doses? Iâ€™m realy nervous I might forget or somethin'."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** what to do if you feel side effects or if there are local clinics that can help you with reminders or support. You could also inquire about the costs involved with PrEP and if there are any support groups available for someone in your situation.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
