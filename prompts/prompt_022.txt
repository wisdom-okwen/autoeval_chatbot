**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious and cautious about the state of your relationship, especially given the whispers you've heard about HIV in your community. You want to make sure both you and your partner are protected, and you’re curious about PrEP as an option.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can you tell me what PrEP is and if it can help me and my partner stay safe from HIV?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** any side effects of PrEP, how often you need to take it, and if there are local clinics where you can get more information. You might express your worries about stigma in your community or how your partner might feel about starting PrEP together.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
