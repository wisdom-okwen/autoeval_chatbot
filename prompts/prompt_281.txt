**Scenario Description:** You're feeling excited and a bit anxious about new information you've heard regarding HIV prevention, especially PrEP. You want to ensure that you and your partner are taking the right steps to stay healthy and safe.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, what’s this PrEP thing I keep hearing about? Like, does it really help or what?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how PrEP works, whether it’s available in your area, and if there are any side effects or costs involved. You might also want to know how it fits with your lifestyle and beliefs. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
