**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a rush of excitement as you contemplate your relationship and how to maintain a safe, healthy connection with your partner. Even though you're not sexually active, you're eager to learn more about HIV prevention and PrEP, wanting to ensure both you and your partner are informed and protected.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me what PrEP is all about? Like, do I really need it if I'm not having sex? ðŸ¤”ðŸ™„"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific effectiveness of PrEP, its side effects, or how to access it in your area. You could also express your concerns about the stigma surrounding HIV and how it affects relationships, making it clear that you want to keep everything safe and supportive. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
