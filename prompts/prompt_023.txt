**Scenario Description:** You feel empowered and ready to take control of your health as you sit down to chat with a chatbot about HIV prevention and PrEP. There's a sense of urgency mixed with a bit of confusion as you want to make sure you protect yourself and understand what options are out there, especially considering your relationships.

**You should start by asking:** "hey, can u tell me what this PrEP thing is? ðŸ˜• like, how does it work and is it even for me? ðŸ¤”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "like, does it really stop HIV? ðŸ˜³ and are there side effects? or is there any special stuff I gotta do? ðŸ™„" 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
