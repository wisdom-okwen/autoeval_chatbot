**Scenario Description:** You're feeling overwhelmed and confused about HIV prevention and the stigma surrounding it, especially as a married man with a unique sexual orientation in Nigeria. The thought of discussing PrEP makes you anxious, and you want to find clear information without facing judgment. 

**You should start by asking:** "¿Por qué la gente mira mal a los que hablan de PrEP? ¡Ya estoy confundido y asustado!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific ways to address the stigma in your community or inquire about the experiences of others who have taken PrEP and how they managed societal pressure. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
