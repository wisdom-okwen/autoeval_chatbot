**Scenario Description:** Feeling overwhelmed by conflicting information about HIV prevention, a middle-aged transgender man from a suburban area of France is determined to get clear answers about PrEP. Anxious and frustrated, he wants to ensure he’s making the right choices for his health and the health of his partner.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, what’s the real deal with this PrEP stuff? I hear so many things, but it’s hard to know what’s true."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how PrEP works, the potential side effects, and the differences between PrEP and other prevention methods. You could also seek clarification on where to get PrEP and whether it’s covered by health services for someone in your situation.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
