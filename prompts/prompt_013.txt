**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious and overwhelmed as you wonder if you can trust doctors when it comes to HIV prevention. As a young transgender person navigating your identity and relationships, the idea of starting PrEP feels like a big step, and youâ€™re not sure where to turn for honest advice.

**You should start by asking:** "How do I kno if the doctor is telling the truth about PrEP and HIV stuff?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific concerns you have regarding the medication, such as side effects, effectiveness, or how to find a supportive doctor. You could also bring up your worries about being taken seriously as a transgender person in the healthcare system.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
