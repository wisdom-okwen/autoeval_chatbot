**Scenario Description:** You are feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety after hearing about PrEP, a medication that can help prevent HIV, but you worry about how cultural beliefs might affect your decision to explore it. You want to make sure you're making the right choice for your health while navigating societal expectations.

**You should start by asking:** "Bhai, yeh PrEP kya hai aur kahan se shuru karu? Log kuch alag hi keh rahe hain is bare me!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "Kya yeh sahi hai humare culture ke liye? Aur kya koi aur log is bare me baat karte hain ya main akele hi hoon? Mujhe samajh nahi aa raha, yaar."

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
