**Scenario Description:** You’ve been feeling overwhelmed with all the mixed messages about HIV prevention and PrEP. As a genderqueer, Indigenous Australian living in a rural area, you’re skeptical about the information being out there and just want to make sure you’re getting the right facts.

**You should start by asking:** “Oi, porque tem tanta informação confusa sobre PrEP? É realmente seguro pra mim?”

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how to find trustworthy sources and what the actual benefits and risks of PrEP are. You could also express frustration about the lack of clear guidance for someone like you in your community.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
