**Scenario Description:** A senior woman from France, navigating the complexities of cultural beliefs and health, feels determined yet anxious about discussing HIV prevention and PrEP. She is worried about the stigma attached to her sexual orientation and the potential implications for her marriage.

**You should start by asking:** "كيف يمكنني الحصول على معلومات موثوقة عن PrEP و الوقاية من HIV؟ أنا مش مرتاحة بالحديث عن هذا الموضوع."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific cultural beliefs that make discussing HIV and PrEP difficult for you, or how you can talk to your spouse about your concerns without facing backlash. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
