**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious and frustrated as you sit in your well-furnished urban apartment in Johannesburg, pondering the high costs of HIV prevention options like PrEP. Recently divorced and navigating your identity as a non-binary individual in a society that can be unforgiving, you’re eager to explore effective and affordable solutions but are worried about managing expenses.

**You should start by asking:** "Écoutez, c'est quoi le coût de PrEP ici? J'suis un peu perdu avec tous ces prix, et j'ai pas envie de me ruiner pour ça."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the different financial assistance programs available, or if there are any clinics that offer PrEP at reduced prices. Your concern about affordability will guide you to seek out practical options and support to ease your anxiety.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
