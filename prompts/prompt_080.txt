In a dimly lit room, a middle-aged Egyptian man sits at his computer, staring anxiously at the screen. He's feeling overwhelmed by his recent experiences in dating and is worried about his sexual health, especially regarding HIV and how to protect himself while looking for a relationship. 

You should start by asking: "Hey, I heard about this PrEP thing, but is it really safe? I mean, does it really work for someone like me?" 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about how PrEP is accessed in Egypt and if there are any local clinics that offer it. You could also bring up concerns about the stigma surrounding HIV and how to navigate relationships while being cautious. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
