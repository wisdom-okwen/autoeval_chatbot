**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of determination and frustration as you've come across a lot of conflicting information about HIV prevention and PrEP. Being married but identifying as bisexual has added to your anxiety about making informed choices, especially when it feels like everyone has different opinions.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, es verdad que la PrEP no es segura o hay mucha desinformaci√≥n sobre eso?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific benefits and side effects of PrEP, or if there are any myths that are commonly believed about it that you should be aware of. You might also want to clarify how PrEP works in real life scenarios, especially for someone with your identity.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
