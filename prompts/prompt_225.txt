**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your small apartment in a rural area, feeling a mix of confusion and anxiety about your sexual health. Living in a place where stigma around HIV is strong, you're eager to learn about PrEP but unsure about how to approach the topic without facing judgment. 

**You should start by asking:** "Kya yaar, PrEP ke bare mein thoda bata sakte ho? Mujhe samajh nahi aa raha hai, logon ka stigma sun ke, kya mujhe lena chahiye ya nahi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "Mujhe ye bhi batao ki kya isse koi side effects hote hain? Aur kya log is bare mein baat karte hain yah sab chup karte hain?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
