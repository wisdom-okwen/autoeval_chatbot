**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling frustrated and anxious about the stigma surrounding HIV and PrEP. As someone who identifies as non-binary and pansexual, you worry about how society views you and your relationship, making you hesitant to seek information openly.

**You should start by asking:** "Pourquoi les gens jugent tant le PrEP ? C'est comme, c'est pour se proteger, non ?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP or how to talk to your partner about using it, expressing your concerns about what others might think. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
