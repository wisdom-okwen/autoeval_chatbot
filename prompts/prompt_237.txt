**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your apartment, feeling anxious about your health and the possibility of needing to talk to your partner about PrEP. While you know it's essential for HIV prevention, the thought of discussing it makes you feel uneasy and doubtful about privacy and how it's perceived.

**You should start by asking:** "So, like, what’s the deal with PrEP? Is it really private? I don’t wanna be judged or somethin’."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific ways PrEP can fit into your lifestyle, concerns about side effects, or how to ensure your health information stays confidential. It's essential to express your worries about discussing this with your partner and how to navigate that conversation.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
