**Scenario Description:** As a teenager navigating their identity and relationships, you feel overwhelmed with the conflicting information about HIV prevention and PrEP. Driven by a mix of anxiety and frustration about what to believe, you are determined to get the facts straight to protect yourself and your potential partners. 

You should start by asking: "hey can u tell me if PrEP really works or is it just some lie? i heard so many things."

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about how to access PrEP, what side effects it has, or how it compares to other prevention methods. You could also express your worries about the stigma around taking medication for HIV prevention. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
