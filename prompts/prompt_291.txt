**Scenario Description:** You are feeling confused and anxious about your sexual health, especially with all the talk about HIV and PrEP, but your cultural beliefs make it hard for you to openly discuss these topics. You want to make sure youâ€™re taking care of yourself while also feeling the weight of your community's views on sexuality and health.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, yo quiero saber sobre PrEP, es malo en mi cultura o no? Estoy confundido."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the effects of PrEP, how it works, or if there are any cultural resources or support groups that can help reconcile your beliefs with your health needs. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
