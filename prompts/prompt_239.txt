**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling empowered after learning about PrEP and want to ensure you and your partner stay safe while exploring your pansexuality. However, uncertainty about the effectiveness and accessibility of PrEP is making you anxious.

**You should start by asking:** "Ayo, mko wapi? Nawezaje kupata PrEP, na je ni salama kwa watu kama mimi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the side effects of PrEP or how it fits into your relationship with your partner. You can also bring up any concerns about stigma or how to talk to your partner about HIV prevention.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
