**Scenario Description:** You just heard about PrEP from a friend and are feeling excited yet anxious about the costs involved. Living in a suburban area with limited resources, you want to make sure that you can access this preventive measure without breaking the bank.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, what is PrEP actually and is it super expensive? I ain't got much money."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** any local clinics that provide PrEP or if there are any financial assistance programs available for someone in your situation. You could also express concerns about the availability of information in your area and how to navigate the healthcare system.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
