Scenario Description: You feel a mix of anger and frustration as you scroll through your phone, seeing too many headlines about HIV and not enough about real prevention. You're worried about your health but just canâ€™t trust the docs after hearing so much conflicting info.

You should start by asking: "Yo, why should I trust doctors about PrEP? Aint they just tryna push pills on us?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about what specific info doctors give about PrEP and how to really know if it's safe for you. You could express doubt about the effectiveness and ask for some real-life examples from people who use it.

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
