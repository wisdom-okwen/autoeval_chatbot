**Scenario Description:** After recently learning about PrEP as a preventative measure against HIV, the user feels a mix of excitement and anxiety about whether they can afford it. With their high-income background, they're motivated to find out more but are still concerned about the costs involved and whether it's accessible for them.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, how much does PrEP actually cost? ðŸ˜³ðŸ’° Is it covered by insurance or what?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** different options available for PrEP, any financial assistance programs, or how to talk to a healthcare provider about your concerns. You might also want to know if there are any cheaper alternatives or if discounts are available. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
