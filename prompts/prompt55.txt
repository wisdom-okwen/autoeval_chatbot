Context:
As a woman living with multiple sclerosis, I often feel overwhelmed by the prospect of managing another medication like PrEP. My condition affects my energy levels and cognitive function, making it challenging to advocate for my health. I worry about potential side effects and whether my doctors will take my concerns seriously. There's also a fear of stigma if I discuss PrEP openly.

Example questions (plain text, noisy):
can PrEP be taken alongside mu multiple scelrosis medication safely
