**Scenario Description:** You're feeling confused and anxious about the information floating around regarding HIV prevention and PrEP, especially with so many mixed messages. As a genderqueer person who identifies as pansexual and values your health, you want to get clear and accurate information to make informed choices.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me what PrEP really is? I keep hearing diff things and I don't kno who to trust."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "Like, does it actually help? And am I safe if I take it? Also, are there side effects I should worry about? I really just need to kno what’s real and what’s not."

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
