**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling anxious as youâ€™ve been hearing a lot about HIV lately, and youâ€™re worried about your health. Youâ€™ve been considering PrEP but are unsure if you can trust doctors to give you the right information about it, especially given your past experiences.

**You should start by asking:** "Nimekuwa nikisikia kuhusu PrEP, lakini naweza kuamini madaktari kuhusu hili? ðŸ¤”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific details regarding how PrEP works, potential side effects, and how to find a trustworthy healthcare provider in your area. You can also express your feelings about trusting doctors and ask if there are community resources or support groups available. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
