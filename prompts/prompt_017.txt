**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your small urban apartment, feeling a mix of curiosity and anxiety about your dating life after being widowed. You’ve heard about PrEP and want to know more about it, especially as you’re exploring new relationships and want to stay safe.

**You should start by asking:** "Ahlan, ma a'raf kafi shay' 'an PrEP... leh khaseh yitnasew m'al 'alaqat wala la?" 

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP or how it works in preventing HIV. You might want to express your concerns about dating and how to bring up the topic of HIV prevention with potential partners.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
