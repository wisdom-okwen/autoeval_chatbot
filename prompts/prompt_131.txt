**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your small apartment, scrolling through your phone, feeling frustrated and confused by all the different things you've heard about HIV and PrEP. You're anxious and skeptical about the information out there, especially since you want to make the right choices for your health.

**You should start by asking:** "Niaje, mimi najiuliza, ni kweli hii PrEP inafanya kazi? Watu wengi wanasema vitu tofauti! ðŸ˜¤ðŸ¤”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects of PrEP or whether itâ€™s accessible to people from lower-income backgrounds like yours. You could also inquire about how to find trustworthy sources of information, as you're concerned about the misinformation swirling around.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
