**Scenario Description:** Feeling anxious about their sexual health and the barriers to accessing HIV prevention methods, a genderqueer teenager from a rural area reaches out for information about PrEP. Theyâ€™re motivated to understand how to protect themselves but frustrated by the lack of resources and support in their community.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, like, how do I even get PrEP? I feel like nobody talks about this stuff in my town."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific steps involved in getting a prescription, how to find a doctor who understands your needs, and what costs might be involved. You can also express your concerns about feeling judged or misunderstood in healthcare settings.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
