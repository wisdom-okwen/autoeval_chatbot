**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in a small caf√© in Johannesburg, feeling a sense of unease about your health and the choices ahead of you. As a young transgender individual who has faced so much loss, you're anxious about whether PrEP is really the right choice for keeping yourself safe from HIV.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, yo quiero saber, de verdad, PrEP es seguro? No estoy seguro si es para mi."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the side effects of PrEP and whether it works for people like you in your specific situation. You could also inquire if there are support groups or resources available for someone who is bisexual and transgender, as you might feel isolated in your journey.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
