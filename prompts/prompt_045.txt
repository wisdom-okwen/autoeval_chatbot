**Scenario Description:** You're sitting at your computer, feeling a mix of frustration and anxiety about whether PrEP would be covered by your insurance. As a senior who identifies as queer, you want to make informed decisions about your health but worry about navigating the complexities of healthcare financing.

**You should start by asking:** "Yo, how do I even know if my insurance gonna cover PrEP? Like, is it even worth it?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** specific coverage details, such as, "What if they say no? Can I fight it? Or, like, are there other options to make it cheaper?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
