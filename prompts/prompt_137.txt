**Scenario Description:** You're feeling determined but frustrated about accessing accurate information on HIV prevention and PrEP in your rural community. You want to make sure you're getting the right details to help others who might be struggling with the same issues, especially after losing a partner.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me how to get PrEP around here? Itâ€™s hard to find info where I live."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** where to find clinics that provide PrEP, what the costs are, or how to talk to doctors about it. Your focus is on ensuring that you and others can access the resources you need without feeling judged or lost.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
