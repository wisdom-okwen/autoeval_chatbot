**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re in a cozy cafÃ© in the heart of Paris, sipping your latte while scrolling through your phone. You feel a mix of curiosity and anxiety about your sexual health, especially regarding HIV prevention and PrEP, and you want to ensure your long-term safety. 

**You should start by asking:** "Salam, can u tell me about PrEP? I heard it help with HIV but Iâ€™m not clear on it ðŸ¤”."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects of PrEP, how effective it is over time, and whether it's accessible for someone in your situation. You could also express your worries about taking medication long-term and any impacts on your body. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
