**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling determined to protect yourself while navigating the complexities of your new dating life after being widowed. Despite your high education level, you’re anxious about how to stay safe and adhere to preventive measures like PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "So, like, how do I even make sure I’m taking PrEP right? I don’t wanna mess it up or forget, ya know?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects of PrEP and how to handle any potential issues with adherence, like, “What if I forget a dose? Is it a big deal?”

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
