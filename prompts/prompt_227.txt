**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious and cautious about the possibility of HIV, especially since you heard about PrEP recently. As a young married man living in an urban area, you want to make informed decisions but are worried about the side effects of medication.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, whatâ€™s up with PrEP? I heard it helps but, like, what about the side effects? ðŸ˜Ÿ"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** specific side effects you're worried about, or if there are alternatives to PrEP. You could also express your concerns about how these medications might affect your daily life and health. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
