**Scenario Description:** You just got back from a community health fair and learned about PrEP, but you still got some doubts about sticking to it. You're feeling empowered to take control of your health, but there's a nagging worry about whether you'll really adhere to the regimen.

**You should start by asking:** "Yo, like, how hard is it to keep takin’ that PrEP stuff? I don’t wanna mess it up, ya feel me?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the best ways to stay on track with taking your medication, what to do if you miss a dose, and whether there are any support groups or apps that can help you out. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
