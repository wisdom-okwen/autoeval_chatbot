**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in a small café in Shanghai, anxiously scrolling through your phone. The bright lights and chatter around you fade into the background as you contemplate your choices regarding HIV prevention, feeling a mix of confusion and urgency about PrEP and its effectiveness.

**You should start by asking:** "Est-ce que PrEP vraiment marche? J'suis inquiet, j'veux pas prendre des risques!!!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific studies or statistics on PrEP's effectiveness in real-life situations, or you could inquire if there are any side effects you should worry about. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
