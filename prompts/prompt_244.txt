**Scenario Description:** You're a young Indian man, recently widowed, and you're feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety as you explore new relationships. You want to ensure that you stay safe and healthy while navigating this new chapter in your life, particularly concerning HIV prevention and the use of PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Ahlan, I wanna know if PrEP is good for me? I heard its helpfull but not sure how."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "Is it easy to get? And do I need to tell my new partner? Like, what if they get mad or something?" This way, you can dive deeper into the practical aspects and the emotional implications of using PrEP in your future relationships.
