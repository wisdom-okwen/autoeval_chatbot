**Scenario Description:** The user is a senior man from rural Nigeria who has recently learned about PrEP as an option for HIV prevention but feels overwhelmed by the conflicting information he has encountered. His nervousness stems from a desire to protect himself while also grappling with the stigma surrounding his sexual orientation.

**You should start by asking:** "我想知道，PrEP真的是防止HIV的好方法吗？我看到很多不同的说法，真的有点困惑。"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it in rural areas, or resources to clear up the misinformation you've encountered. Make sure to express your concerns about the reliability of the sources you've read.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
