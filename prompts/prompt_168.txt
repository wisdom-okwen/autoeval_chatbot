**Scenario Description:** Feeling empowered but concerned about her privacy, a South African woman in her 30s is determined to learn more about HIV prevention and PrEP. She's navigating a world that often feels overwhelming and stigmatizing, but she’s ready to take control of her health.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me how PrEP works? Like, is it really private? I don’t want no one in my biz."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "What if I take it and my family finds out? I can't have that, man! Plus, how do I get it without everyone knowin'? What’s the deal with cost too?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
