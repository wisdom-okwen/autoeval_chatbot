**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting at home after a long day, feeling frustrated by the misinformation you've heard about HIV and PrEP lately. As a pansexual person in a low-income urban area of Brazil, you’re anxious about making informed decisions regarding your health and want to clarify misconceptions.

**You should start by asking:** "Y do pple say PrEP is dangerous? I hear so many wrong things, its messin with my head!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects of PrEP, how it works, and whether it’s accessible for someone in your financial situation. You could also bring up concerns about the stigma surrounding HIV and how it affects people like you.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
