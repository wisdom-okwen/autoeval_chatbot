**Scenario Description:** You sit alone in your upscale apartment in Johannesburg, feeling a mix of anxiety and frustration about your sexual health. After hearing conflicting information about HIV prevention and PrEP, youâ€™re determined to find clear answers that can help you feel secure in your decisions.

**You should start by asking:** "Salut, je veux savoir si PrEP vraiment marche pour des gens comme moi? J'entends des trucs et je suis perdu."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the specific effectiveness rates of PrEP for different demographics or if there are any side effects that are commonly reported among transgender individuals. You could also express your feelings about the stigma you face when discussing these topics and seek advice on how to approach conversations with healthcare providers.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
