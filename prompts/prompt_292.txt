Scenario Description: Feeling overwhelmed and anxious about his health, a senior man in a suburban area of France is concerned about HIV prevention and the long-term safety of medications like PrEP. He is in a relationship and wants to ensure both he and his partner are protected, but he's unsure about the right steps to take.

You should start by asking: "Hey, I need to know is PrEP safe long time? What if I take it many years, any side effects or problems?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the specific risks associated with taking PrEP long-term or inquire if there are any alternatives for someone in your situation. Express your worries about what could happen in the future if you go on this medication.

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
