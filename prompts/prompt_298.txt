**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of curiosity and anxiety about getting more informed about HIV prevention and PrEP options, especially since youâ€™re worried about how to afford healthcare and insurance coverage. You sit down with your phone, ready to ask questions, but there's a nagging feeling in your stomach about the whole situation.

**You should start by asking:** "Bhai, mujhe samajh nahi aa raha ki PrEP kya hai? Kya yeh insurance se cover hoga ya nahi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP and whether there are support programs for low-income individuals that could help with costs. You could also inquire about how to talk to your partner about starting PrEP, and if there's a way to find local clinics that offer it at a reduced price.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
