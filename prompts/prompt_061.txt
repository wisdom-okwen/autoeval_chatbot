**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling empowered and determined to make informed choices about your health, especially regarding HIV prevention. You’ve heard a lot of conflicting information about PrEP and its effectiveness, and you’re frustrated with the misinformation that surrounds it.

**You should start by asking:** "Why people say PrEP no good? I hear all this talk, but I don’t believe it. Is it really safe?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it in your area, and whether it’s suitable for someone like you who is bisexual and married. You might also express your frustrations about the stigma or misinformation you’ve encountered in your community.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
