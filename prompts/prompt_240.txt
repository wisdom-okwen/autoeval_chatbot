**Scenario Description:**  
Feeling a mix of curiosity and anxiety, you’ve been reading about PrEP to prevent HIV, but your mind keeps circling back to the potential side effects. You want to make sure you’re making an informed decision, especially since you’ve heard so many conflicting opinions from your friends and online.

**Opening Question:**  
You should start by asking: “Hey, I heard of this PrEP thing for HIV, but what about the side effects? Like, do they really suck, or is it just hype?”

**Guidance for Follow-up Turns:**  
As the conversation progresses, you might ask about specific side effects you’ve heard of, or if there are options for managing them. You could say something like, “What do people do if they get sick from it? Is it bad enough to stop me from taking it?” 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
