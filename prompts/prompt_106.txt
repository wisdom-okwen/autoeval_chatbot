**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious about your sexual health and worried about maintaining your privacy while exploring options for HIV prevention. As a transgender individual navigating the complexities of sexuality and health, you want to ensure you have the right information to protect yourself without compromising your identity.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, mira, estoy un poco nervioso, pero necesito saber sobre PrEP. Â¿Como funciona eso y es seguro para mi sin que nadie se entere?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the confidentiality of the treatment and whether there are any specific clinics or health services that respect your privacy. You could also inquire about the experiences of others in similar situations to gauge their comfort and safety.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
