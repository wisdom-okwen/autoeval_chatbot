**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious and frustrated about the rumors circulating in your community regarding HIV and the options available for protection. You’re in a relationship and want to ensure both you and your partner stay safe, but you’re worried about what people might think if they find out you're looking into PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "hey, can u plz tell me if PrEP is like realy good or is it just some hype? i dunno what to believe."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how PrEP works, if it’s accessible for someone with your background, or what people in your community think about it. You could express your concerns about how others might judge you for seeking information or using PrEP.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
