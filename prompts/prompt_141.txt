**Scenario Description:** You're a senior transgender individual from a rural area in Nigeria, feeling overwhelmed by the complexities of HIV prevention and the options available, especially when it comes to accessing PrEP. You've heard mixed information and are worried about your health insurance covering the necessary medications.

**You should start by asking:** "Why is PrEP so important? I hear about it but I feel lost and worried about money for insurance."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** whether there are specific clinics that offer affordable PrEP options or how to navigate health insurance plans that might cover treatments. You may also want to express your concerns about side effects or the stigma associated with being on PrEP.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
