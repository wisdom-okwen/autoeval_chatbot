**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious and skeptical about the whole PrEP thing. You’ve heard some good stuff, but you’re not sure if it’s really worth it or if you can stick to it, especially living out in the sticks where info is scarce.

**You should start by asking:** "Oye, es verdad que PrEP es fácil pa' seguir? Yo no estoy seguro si puedo hacerlo, ya sabes?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** what happens if you miss a dose or if there are any side effects. You might also want to know how often you need to get tested while on PrEP. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
