Scenario Description: You’re feeling anxious about your upcoming travel plans, especially regarding your sexual health and the potential risk of HIV. You want to know more about PrEP, but you’re worried about how to bring it up in conversation without sounding too out of place.

You should start by asking: "ياريت تقولي عن PrEP وايش يعني وكيف ينقذني لو سافرت؟" (Can you tell me about PrEP and what it means, and how it can protect me when I travel?)

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the side effects, where you can get PrEP, and if it’s covered by insurance since you’re traveling soon. You can express your worries about maintaining your health while being in new places.

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
