**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re sitting in a quiet corner of your suburban apartment, feeling a mix of curiosity and anxiety about your health and privacy. You've heard about PrEP for HIV prevention but worry about how discussing this could affect your privacy, especially being a transgender person in a middle-income neighborhood.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me how PrEP works and if it safe for people like me, like what about privacy stuff?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it discreetly, or if there are support groups for people in similar situations. You could also express concerns about how your gender identity might affect your interactions with healthcare providers. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
