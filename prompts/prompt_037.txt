**Scenario Description:** You are feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the rumors circulating in your community regarding HIV and how people view those who seek help. You want to ensure you take care of yourself while worrying about what others might think if they knew you were considering PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Is it true that taking PrEP makes people think I got HIV or something? I don’t want my neighbors talkin’ about me."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the confidentiality of PrEP services in your area and if there are any local clinics that understand your situation. You could also express your worries about how to explain your decision to your friends and family without facing judgment.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
