**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety as you think about taking control of your health, especially regarding HIV prevention. You want to ensure that you can trust the information you receive, particularly from healthcare professionals, so you’re eager to discuss PrEP but also hesitant about who to believe.

**You should start by asking:** "Ningependa kujua, je, PrEP ni ya kweli? Na je, daktari anaweza kuaminika kuhusu hii?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects of PrEP and how you can ensure that you’re getting accurate and trustworthy information from healthcare providers. You could also express your concerns about affordability and how to access these services in your area.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
