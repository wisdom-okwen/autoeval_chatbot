**Scenario Description:** You're a senior Indigenous Australian woman living in a rural area, feeling confused and anxious about the lack of information on HIV prevention and PrEP. You want to ensure you and your partner are protected and are frustrated by the barriers to accessing reliable resources.

**You should start by asking:** "Why is it so hard to find info on PrEP in rural areas? ðŸ˜¡ I feel like I'm lost and no one is helping me!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the specific resources available in your area, the differences between PrEP and other prevention methods, or even how to talk to your doctor about getting PrEP. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
