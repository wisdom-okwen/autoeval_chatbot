**Scenario Description:** As a teenager from a rural area in South Africa, you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious about your sexual health, especially regarding HIV prevention. You’re in a relationship and there’s a lot of pressure to understand your options, but you’re also worried that nobody in your community will take your concerns seriously, so you’re seeking support.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I don’t kno much about PrEP, but like, is it realy safe? I mean, like, can it help me not get HIV?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the differences between PrEP and other prevention methods, or express your worries about stigma in your community, such as, "How do I even talk about this with my partner? Like, what if they freak out?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
