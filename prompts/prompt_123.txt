**Scenario Description:** The user is feeling overwhelmed and confused about their sexual health after hearing rumors about HIV in their community. As a senior genderqueer person living in rural India, they are unsure of how to access information, support, and PrEP, feeling both anxious and frustrated by the lack of resources.

**You should start by asking:** "Où je peux trouver des infos sur PrEP et comment ça marche?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how to get PrEP prescriptions in rural areas or where to find local health services that offer support for queer individuals. You could also bring up concerns about side effects or the effectiveness of PrEP. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
