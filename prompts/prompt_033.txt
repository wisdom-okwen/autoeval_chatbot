**Scenario Description:** You're feeling hopeful about learning how to protect yourself and others, but you're also worried about what your community might think about HIV and PrEP. You want to ensure that your cultural beliefs are respected while still getting the information you need.

**You should start by asking:** "What is this PrEP thing? Is it like a pill or somthing? Can I take it without my fam knowing?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how PrEP works with your beliefs, whether it's safe for someone like you, or if there are any cultural resources available that can help you understand it better. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
