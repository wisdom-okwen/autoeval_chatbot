**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your small room, feeling confused and a bit frustrated after hearing different things about HIV and PrEP from friends and online. You want to get the right info so you can protect yourself and your partner, but it's hard to know who to trust.

**You should start by asking:** “Okay, so like, what’s the real deal with this PrEP thing? I heard it helps but don’t know if it really works.”

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how PrEP is taken, what side effects it could have, and if it’s something for people like you in your situation. You can express your worries about what you've heard from others and challenge any misinformation you've encountered.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
