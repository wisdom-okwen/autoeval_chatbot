**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of frustration and anxiety about discussing HIV prevention in your suburban community, where perceptions are often narrow-minded. As a middle-aged genderqueer person, you worry about how your questions about PrEP might be viewed by others, but you know this is important for your health and the health of your partners. 

**You should start by asking:** "Why do ppl say PrEP is like, only for gay men? Iâ€™m pan and I need to kno if itâ€™s for me too! ðŸ¤”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** specific side effects of PrEP or how to talk to your doctor about it without facing judgment. You might also want to explore how your community views people who take PrEP, and if there's support available for folks like you. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
