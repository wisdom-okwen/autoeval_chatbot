**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in a small café in Johannesburg, feeling a mix of anxiety and determination. You’ve heard whispers in your community about PrEP and HIV prevention, but you're worried about what others might think if they knew you were asking these questions.

**You should start by asking:** "Mujhe samajh nahi aata, PrEP kya hota hai aur ye kaise madad karta hai HIV se bachaane mein?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "Lekin log kya sochenge agar main iske liye jaoun? Kya yeh theek hai?" and "Kya yeh sirf meri jaisi aurton ke liye hai ya aur bhi koi hai jo use karte hain?"

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
