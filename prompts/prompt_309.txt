**Scenario Description:** You're feeling really anxious and frustrated about the stigma surrounding HIV in your rural community. As a single gay man, you want to know more about PrEP, but you're worried about how people will judge you if they find out you're seeking this information.

**You should start by asking:** "PrEP kya hai? Ye kya meri madad karega ya log mujhe dekhenge aur samjhenge kya? Bahut logo ko pata chalega toh kya hoga?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** any side effects of PrEP, how to access it discreetly in your area, or whether there are local support groups that understand your situation. You can also express your fears about being judged and the challenge of discussing these topics openly.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
