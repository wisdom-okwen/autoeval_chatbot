**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of frustration and confusion about how your cultural beliefs around sex and relationships affect your understanding of HIV prevention, especially regarding PrEP. As a highly educated woman, you want to explore these topics deeply but feel overwhelmed by the lack of resources that address your specific concerns.

**You should start by asking:** "Haan, mujhe samajh nahi aata PrEP ke baray mein, kya yeh sahi hai mere liye ya nahi, kyunki main toh asexual hoon. Yeh kya hai sab kuch?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the cultural stigma surrounding HIV in your community, or how PrEP is perceived among those who share your background and beliefs. You might also want to dig deeper into how PrEP can fit into an asexual lifestyle, questioning its necessity and implications.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
