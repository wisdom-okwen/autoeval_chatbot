**Scenario Description:** You're feeling super confused about HIV prevention and PrEP, especially with all the stigma surrounding it in your rural community. You want to make sure you and your partner are safe, but the judgment from others makes it hard to talk openly.

**You should start by asking:** "كيف اقدر احمي نفسي من HIV؟ وشنو يعتبر PrEP؟ 🤔" 

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "هل فيه اثار جانبيه لـ PrEP؟ واذا ابغى احصل عليه، لازم اروح لمين؟ 🏥💔"

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
