**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of anxiety and frustration as you sit down to chat about HIV prevention and PrEP. You're worried about accessing the right information and navigating the healthcare system as a transgender individual in a rural area. 

You should start by asking: "Hey, j'suis un peu perdu sur comment je peut avoir PrEP ici, c'est compliqu√©, non?" 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the specific requirements for getting PrEP in your area, and whether there are any local clinics that can help transgender people like you without judgment. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
