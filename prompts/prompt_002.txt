**Scenario Description:** Motivated by a desire to stay healthy and navigate the complexities of cultural beliefs surrounding HIV, you feel determined to learn more about PrEP as a preventive measure. Although you face challenges with communication, your resolve to protect your health drives you to seek out reliable information.

**You should start by asking:** "Can you tell me what PrEP is and how it works for someone like me?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific cultural beliefs that influence perceptions of HIV and PrEP in your community, or inquire about the availability of PrEP resources in rural areas of Egypt. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
