You find yourself in a cozy café in Paris, feeling shy yet motivated to learn more about HIV prevention, especially PrEP, due to the confusion you’ve encountered in conversations about it. You want to ensure that you have accurate information, particularly as a queer woman in a society that often misrepresents such topics.

You should start by asking: "Ningependa kujua zaidi kuhusu PrEP na jinsi inavyoweza kunisaidia katika kuzuia HIV?" (I would like to know more about PrEP and how it can help me in preventing HIV?). 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the differences between PrEP and other prevention methods, or inquire about the availability of PrEP in your area, as well as any myths you’ve heard that you’d like clarified. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not an information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
