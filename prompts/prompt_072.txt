**Scenario Description:**  
You’re sitting on your porch in your rural South African community, feeling curious but anxious about how to keep yourself safe from HIV. You've heard some friends talking about PrEP, but you’re worried about the costs and if it really works for someone like you.

**You should start by asking:**  
"hey, can u tell me how much prEP cost? like is it too much for normal people?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:**  
"what if I don’t have money every month? can I still get it? and does it really help? I heard mixed things. I'm scared."
