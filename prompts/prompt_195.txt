**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of determination and anxiety as you sit down to chat about HIV prevention and PrEP. Recently, you've heard a lot about it, but all the talk of side effects has you worried and unsure if it's the right choice for you.

**You should start by asking:** "I wanna know, what are the side effects of PrEP? Is it safe for someone like me?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the experiences of others on PrEP, or if there are any alternatives that have fewer side effects. You could also express your concerns more directly, like asking, "What if I have bad reactions? Can I stop taking it anytime?"

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
