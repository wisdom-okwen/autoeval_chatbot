**Scenario Description:** As a senior woman navigating the complexities of her pansexual identity in a conservative community, the user feels a mix of anxiety and frustration about discussing HIV prevention openly. She worries about how people in her social circles might perceive her, especially since she’s divorced and exploring new relationships.

**You should start by asking:** "Why is PrEP so important for people like me? I mean, I don’t even know if my friends will accept this talk at all."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the specific risks associated with your lifestyle choices or how to approach the subject of PrEP with potential partners. You could also inquire about how to address community stigma regarding HIV. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
