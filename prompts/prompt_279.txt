**Scenario Description:** Sitting in a bustling cafÃ© in Cairo, you feel a mix of anxiety and determination as you think about your health and how your community might view your choices. You want to know more about HIV prevention and PrEP, but you're worried about what others might think of you asking about it.

**You should start by asking:** "Bhai, kya PrEP ke bare mein thoda samjha sakte ho? Log kya socheinge agar mai yeh le loon? ðŸ˜Ÿ"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how it can work with your life, and what your community really thinks about it. You could also bring up concerns about confidentiality and stigma. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
