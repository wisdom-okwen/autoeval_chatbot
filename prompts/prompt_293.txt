**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re sitting in a cozy coffee shop, feeling a mix of anxiety and determination about ensuring your health and the health of your partner. You're motivated to learn more about PrEP but feeling shy and unsure about how to approach the topic, especially given your concerns about insurance coverage.

**You should start by asking:** "Oye, como puedo saber si mi seguro cubre el PrEP? ðŸ¤”ðŸ’”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific requirements for getting PrEP through your insurance, or whether there are any programs that help with costs. You could also inquire about the side effects and what to expect when starting PrEP, since you want to be fully informed for both you and your partnerâ€™s sake. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
