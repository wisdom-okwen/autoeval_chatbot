**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling overwhelmed and anxious about your sexual health and the effectiveness of HIV prevention methods, especially PrEP. As a young adult in a relationship, you want to ensure you’re making the best choices but are unsure where to start.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me if PrEP really works? I hear so many stuff but not sure what to believe."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP or how to access it in your rural area. You could also bring up concerns about your partner and how to discuss these topics together. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
