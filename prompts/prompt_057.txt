**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling empowered after learning about HIV prevention but also anxious about the stigma surrounding it in your community. You want to know more about PrEP, but you fear being judged or misunderstood.

**You should start by asking:** "Kya PrEP lene se log mujhe stigma denge? Main kya karu agar log samajh nahi rahe hain?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects of PrEP and whether it really helps in reducing the risk of HIV. You can also inquire about how to find support or resources in your area that are accepting of your identity. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
