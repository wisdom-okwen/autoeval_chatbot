**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling hopeful about learning more on how to protect yourself and your partner from HIV, but the fear of stigma from your community weighs heavily on you. You want information on PrEP but are anxious about how people might react if they found out.

**You should start by asking:** "Ab kya kare? PrEP ke bare me janna chahta hu, par log kya sochenge ye sochke dar lagta hai." 

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects of PrEP and how it works, as well as any local resources where you could get it without facing judgment. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
