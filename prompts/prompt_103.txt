In a busy suburban caf√©, a non-binary teenager, buzzing with excitement but also a hint of anxiety, pulls out their phone to chat about HIV prevention and PrEP. They are driven by a desire to understand more about access to these resources, especially given their low-income background.

You should start by asking: "hey, can i get PrEP if i dont have much money? like, wat r my options?" 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about where to find local clinics or programs that offer PrEP for free or on a sliding scale. You could also explore if there are any community resources or support groups for someone in your situation. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
