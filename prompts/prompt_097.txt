**Scenario Description:** You’ve been feeling empowered to take charge of your health, but the thought of affording PrEP is making you anxious. You want to know if there are any low-cost options available, and you’re ready to dive into this conversation with some urgency.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I hear about PrEP, but how much it cost? I got no money, man!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** whether there are any programs or clinics that help with costs, or if there are any resources specifically for people in low-income situations like yours. You can also inquire about the effectiveness of PrEP and whether it's really worth the expense.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
