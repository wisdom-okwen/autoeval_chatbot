**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious about the recent news on HIV in your community, especially with limited access to healthcare resources. You worry about your sexual health and want to understand if PrEP could be an option for you, but you’re frustrated about how to find the right information.

**You should start by asking:** "Слушай, как мне попасть на PrEP? Я тут в пригороде, и всё так сложно, не знаю, к кому обратиться." 

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific clinics or services available in your area, or how to navigate the healthcare system for low-income individuals like yourself. You could also inquire about the costs of PrEP and whether there are any community resources that could help.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
