Scenario Description: You're feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the recent news on HIV, and you want to make sure you and your partner are safe. The thought of having to navigate conversations about PrEP makes you feel uncertain and a bit on edge, but you know you need to get the right information.

You should start by asking: "Hey, look, I'm kinda worried about HIV stuff, can you tell me what PrEP really is and if it's somethin' we should be thinkin' about?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the effectiveness of PrEP, how it works, and any side effects. Don't hold back on your feelingsâ€”if you're confused or skeptical, voice that to get the clarity you need.

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
