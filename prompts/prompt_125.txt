**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious about your sexual health and the risk of HIV, especially living in a rural area where information can be hard to come by. Your concern about privacy makes you hesitant to discuss these issues openly, but you know you need to learn about options like PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Oi, eu ouvi falar de PrEP, mas n sei se eh seguro pra mim... como isso funciona e é privado?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** what the side effects of PrEP are, how it can fit into your life without anyone knowing, and if there are local clinics that provide it discreetly. You could also inquire about how to maintain your privacy when accessing these services.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
