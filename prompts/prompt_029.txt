**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling frustrated and confused about the stigma surrounding HIV and PrEP in your community, and you're eager to learn how to protect yourself without being judged. You just want to find clear answers, but you’re worried about how your questions will be received.

**You should start by asking:** "Yo, like, what’s the deal with PrEP? Is it really as good as they say or just some hype?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the cultural beliefs around HIV in your area, or if there are any local clinics where you can get more info without people looking at you funny. You might also want to know about how to talk to your friends about it without sounding weird.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
