Context:
As someone living with chronic pain, I often worry about how new medications could affect my current treatment plan. I'm fearful that adding PrEP might complicate my situation or intensify my pain management challenges. I also feel a sense of stigma around discussing my sexual health due to the pain I deal with daily, which makes it harder for me to seek information or support.
