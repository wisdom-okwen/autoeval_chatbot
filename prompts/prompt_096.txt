**Scenario Description:** You sit in your bright suburban apartment, feeling a wave of anxiety wash over you as you think about your sexual health. The recent news articles about HIV rates in your community have left you worried and desperate for solid information on prevention methods, particularly regarding PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, estoy preocupado sobre el VIH. ¿Cuánta efectividad tiene el PrEP realmente?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** specific studies or data that illustrate PrEP's effectiveness in various populations, or inquire about potential side effects and how they might affect you. You may also want to know how accessible PrEP is in your area and what the process for getting it entails.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
