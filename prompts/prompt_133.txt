**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling a mix of worry and determination as you navigate the complexities of relationships and health, particularly regarding HIV prevention. You want to ensure that you’re taking the right steps to protect yourself and your partner, and you’re ready to seek out clear information about PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Nina, jua na kwa nini PrEP ni muhimu? Na inafanya kazi vipi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the potential side effects of PrEP and how it fits into a healthy relationship. You could also bring up concerns about how to discuss PrEP with your partner and the importance of regular testing.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
