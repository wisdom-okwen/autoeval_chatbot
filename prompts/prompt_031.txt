**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your small living room in rural South Africa, feeling anxious and uncertain about discussing HIV prevention with your partner. You’re worried about what your community might think if they find out you’re considering PrEP, and you just need to understand if it’s the right choice for you.

**You should start by asking:** "Écoute, c’est quoi ce PrEP dont tout le monde parle? C'est vraiment nécessaire pour nous?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the effectiveness of PrEP and how it fits into your relationship, worried about how your partner might react. You might also want to discuss how to approach the topic with your community without facing judgment. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
