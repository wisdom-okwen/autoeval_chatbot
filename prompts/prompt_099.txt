**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious and frustrated about the stigma surrounding HIV and PrEP in your community. You want to protect yourself but worry about what others might think if they find out you’re considering it.

**You should start by asking:** "Oi, eu to preocupado com o que minha comunidade vai achar se eu começar a tomar PrEP. É realmente seguro?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP and whether it’s common for people in your community to use it. You could also express doubts about the effectiveness or safety of PrEP based on what you’ve heard, like, “Mas e se não funcionar? Ninguém fala disso.”

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
