**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious and a bit overwhelmed about the whole HIV thing. You wanna make sure you can stay safe, but it’s hard to find the right info, especially when it comes to PrEP and how to get it.

**You should start by asking:** "Yo, how can I even get PrEP in Nigeria? Like, is it even possible for me?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the costs involved, whether there are clinics that provide it discreetly, and what the process is like for someone in your situation. You might also wanna know if there’s any support groups or places you could connect with others who understand your worries.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
