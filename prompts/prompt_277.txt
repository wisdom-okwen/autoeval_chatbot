**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling frustrated and anxious about the lack of clear information on HIV prevention, especially since your friends seem to be getting mixed messages. As a young adult living in a rural area, you want to ensure your health and the health of those around you, but you feel overwhelmed and unsure about where to start.

**You should start by asking:** "Can you tell me what PrEP is and how it works for people like me?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it in your area, and what the costs might be since your financial situation is tight. You may also want to express your doubts about the effectiveness of these methods given what you've heard from others.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
