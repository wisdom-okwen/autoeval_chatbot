**Scenario Description:**  
A senior woman from a rural area in Kenya is feeling anxious and uncertain about her health. With limited resources and a relationship to consider, she is worried about how to stay safe from HIV and is seeking information about PrEP, but she feels overwhelmed and skeptical about finding the right answers.

**You should start by asking:**  
"Как я могу получить информацию о ПрЭП, если я так нервничаю и не знаю, как следовать этому?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:**  
specific concerns regarding the accessibility of PrEP in your area, how to maintain adherence to the medication, or the potential side effects you might be worried about. Your emotional state may lead you to express frustration about the information available, seeking reassurance from the chatbot.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
