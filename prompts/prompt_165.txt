**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling empowered and ready to take control of your health, but there’s a part of you that’s anxious about how to get the right info on HIV prevention and PrEP, especially with your low income. You want to make sure you’re taking the right steps, but you're worried about the barriers you might face.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, how can a person like me, who ain't got much money, get PrEP or find out about HIV stuff?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** specific local resources, such as clinics that offer affordable services, or how to talk to doctors about your needs without feeling judged. You could also inquire about any community programs that support young queer folks like yourself in accessing health care.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
