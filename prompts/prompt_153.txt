**Scenario Description:** After attending a local health fair, you're feeling empowered but also anxious about discussing HIV prevention and PrEP. You want to ensure that your privacy is respected while getting the information you need.

**You should start by asking:** "Oi, eu queria saber se PrEP é seguro pra mim e como eu posso pegar isso sem ninguém saber. É tudo muito confuso!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific steps to access PrEP discreetly, what information is required for a prescription, and whether there are local clinics that respect privacy. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
