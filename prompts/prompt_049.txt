**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your small apartment in a suburban area of Nigeria, feeling anxious about your relationship and the risk of HIV. You want to ensure you and your partner stay safe, but you're worried about how your community will perceive you if they find out you're exploring PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, whatâ€™s this PrEP thing? Is it really gonna help me not get HIV, or is it just some hype?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how often you need to take it, and whether your partner should also consider it. You could also express your worries about what your friends or family might think if they find out about you considering it.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
