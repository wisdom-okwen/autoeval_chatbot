**Scenario Description:** You're sitting alone in your small, rural home, feeling anxious about the rising talk of HIV and how to protect yourself, especially considering your unique circumstances. Being widowed and low-income, you worry about how to navigate this complex health issue while maintaining your privacy and dignity.

**You should start by asking:** "Uh, can u tell me what PrEP is? I heard it can help, but I ain't sure how safe it is for me."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the long-term effects of PrEP and if there are any local resources for someone like you who feels shy and unsure. You might also want to inquire about how PrEP fits into your daily life and any potential side effects that could be concerning.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
