**Scenario Description:** You're feeling overwhelmed by all the conflicting info about HIV prevention and PrEP out there. You just wanna make sure you're safe, but everyone around you seems to have a different opinion, and it's making you kinda anxious and furious at the same time.

**You should start by asking:** "Yo, I keep hearin diff stuff 'bout PrEP, like is it even safe? Can I trust it or nah?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** what the side effects of PrEP are or whether it's easy to get it in your area. You could also wanna know how it works alongside other prevention methods. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
