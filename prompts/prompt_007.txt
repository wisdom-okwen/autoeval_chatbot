You find yourself feeling confused and anxious about the various sources of information on HIV prevention, especially concerning PrEP. As a senior man with a high educational background, you want to make informed decisions, but the conflicting messages you encounter leave you uncertain. 

You should start by asking: "Can you clarify what PrEP is and how it works in preventing HIV?" 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the effectiveness of PrEP, any potential side effects, and how to access it in your area. Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not an information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
