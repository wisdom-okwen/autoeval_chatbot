**Scenario Description:** As a transgender teenager living in a suburban area of France, you feel overwhelmed and confused about your sexual health, especially regarding HIV prevention and the use of PrEP. You want to ensure your long-term safety as you explore your sexuality but find it difficult to navigate the complex information available to you.

**You should start by asking:** "¿Qué es PrEP y cómo puede ayudarme a sentirme más seguro en mis relaciones?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the potential side effects of PrEP, how to access it given your low-income background, and resources for LGBTQ+ youth in your community that might provide support. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
