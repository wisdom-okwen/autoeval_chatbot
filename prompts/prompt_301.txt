**Scenario Description:** Feeling anxious and determined to safeguard her health, a young Nigerian woman is seeking clarity on HIV prevention and the PrEP medication after hearing mixed opinions from friends. Sheâ€™s frustrated by the lack of straightforward information and wants assurance that the steps she takes will be covered by her insurance.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me if PrEP works for me? Does insurance cover it?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** whether there are specific requirements for getting PrEP through her insurance, if there are any side effects to watch for, or how often she needs to go for check-ups while on PrEP. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
