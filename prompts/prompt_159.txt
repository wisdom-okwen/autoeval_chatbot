**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of confusion and anxiety over the effectiveness of PrEP for HIV prevention. With your postgraduate education, you're used to seeking out reliable information, but the conflicting messages you hear leave you feeling frustrated and uncertain.

**You should start by asking:** “Is PrEP really that effective? I hear different stuff, and I dunno who to trust.”

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** side effects, the process of getting PrEP, or if there are specific groups that benefit more from it. You could also bring up your concerns about stigma and how it might affect your marriage.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
