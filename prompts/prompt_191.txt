**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in a small, quiet corner of your home, feeling anxious about your health and the potential risks associated with your sexual relationship. You want to learn more about HIV prevention and PrEP, but you're worried about privacy and how to ask the right questions without revealing too much.

**You should start by asking:** "Kya PrEP ke bare me mujhe kuch pata karna chahiye? Yeh kitna safe hai aur isse lena kitna mushkil hai?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the different ways to get PrEP without compromising your privacy, or you could inquire about any potential side effects that could affect you. You might also want to explore how other people in similar situations have managed to stay safe.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
