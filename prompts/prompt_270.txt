Scenario Description: You feel a weight on your shoulders as you sit in the small kitchen of your rural home, worried about the potential risks of HIV due to your relationship and your pansexuality. Determined to protect your health, you decide to seek information about PrEP, yet you can't shake off the anxiety about possible side effects that might come with it.

You should start by asking: "Excusez-moi, mais pouvez-vous me dire si PrEP a des effets secondaires graves?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the specific side effects that are common with PrEP, and whether there are ways to manage them. You could also inquire about how effective it really is in preventing HIV, especially for someone in your situation.

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
