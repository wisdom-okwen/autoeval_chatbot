**Scenario Description:** The user, a young transgender individual living in an urban area of Nigeria, feels overwhelmed and anxious about their sexual health after losing their spouse. They are worried about HIV prevention and finding reliable information about PrEP, feeling frustrated by the stigma they face in their community.

**You should start by asking:** "How do I even know if PrEP is safe for me? I just lost my partner, and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how to access PrEP, what the side effects are, or if there are community resources available for someone in your situation. Express your worries about how people will judge you for seeking help and how that makes you feel.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
