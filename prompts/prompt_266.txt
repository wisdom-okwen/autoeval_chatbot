**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious and skeptical about your upcoming trip abroad, especially regarding your health and safety. You’ve heard mixed things about HIV prevention and PrEP and want to make sure you’re well-informed before you go.

**You should start by asking:** "Oi, eu preciso saber, como que o PrEP funciona realmente? É seguro pra mim se eu viajar?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** specific concerns related to accessing PrEP while traveling, any side effects you should be aware of, or how to discuss this with your doctor. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
