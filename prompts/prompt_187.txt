**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your small, cozy room in rural Brazil, feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety about starting PrEP for HIV prevention. As a transgender person navigating the health system, you want to make sure youâ€™re fully informed and can adhere to the treatment successfully. 

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I heard about this PrEP thing, but like, how do I actually take it and stick with it? What if I forget?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how often you need to go for check-ups, and what to do if you miss a dose. You might also share your worries about being supported in your rural community while on this medication. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
