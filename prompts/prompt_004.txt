**Scenario Description:** You are a middle-aged male living in a suburban area of France, feeling empowered to take control of your health and well-being. Recently, you have been learning about HIV prevention methods, particularly PrEP, and you want to understand how cost might impact your ability to access these options.

**You should start by asking:** "Ninani gharama za PrEP hapa Ufaransa, na kuna mipango yoyote ya kusaidia michango ya gharama hizo?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the effectiveness of PrEP, how to access it through local healthcare providers, and if there are any financial assistance programs available for high-income individuals. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
