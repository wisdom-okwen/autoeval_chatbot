**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re sitting in your small rural home in Brazil, feeling a mix of confusion and concern about your health after hearing about HIV and PrEP from a friend. Youâ€™re motivated to take charge of your sexual health but are frustrated by the lack of clear information available to you, especially when it comes to long-term safety.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, por que la gente dice que PrEP es seguro? ðŸ¤” No entiendo y me preocupa q pueda ser peligroso."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the differences between PrEP and other prevention methods, or whether your lifestyle or health conditions might affect the safety of taking PrEP. You could express your worries about the stigma around HIV and how it affects people in your community, wanting to know how to navigate those conversations.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
