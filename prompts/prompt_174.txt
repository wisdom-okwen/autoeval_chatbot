**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling frustrated and anxious about the lack of information available in your rural area regarding HIV prevention and PrEP. You want to ensure that you and your partner can take safe steps in your sexual health, but you feel lost in finding the right resources.

**You should start by asking:** "Oi, eu quero saber como conseguir PrEP aqui, é facil? Onde eu posso ir pra isso?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the costs involved, whether there are local clinics that provide PrEP, and if there are any online resources tailored for people in rural areas. You could also inquire about the experiences of others in similar situations.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
