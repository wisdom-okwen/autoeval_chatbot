**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling curious about your sexual health, particularly regarding HIV prevention and PrEP, but youâ€™re also skeptical about the medical industry because youâ€™ve had mixed experiences with doctors in the past. As a young adult navigating your identity and personal loss, you want to ensure you make the right choices for yourself without feeling pressured.

**You should start by asking:** "Salut, je veux savoir si PrEP c'est vraiment efficace pour les gens comme moi? ðŸ¤”ðŸ’”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the different ways PrEP is taken, its side effects, and how to find a trustworthy doctor who respects your concerns. You can express your worries about having a doctor who understands your background and your experiences. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
