**Scenario Description:** You're feeling really cautious and a bit anxious about the talk around HIV prevention. You've heard a lot of confusing stuff, and you just want to get the right info so you can take care of yourself and feel safe in your relationships.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I keep hearing about PrEP but not sure if its for me, can it really help stop HIV?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how PrEP works, any side effects, or where you can get it in Nigeria. You could also want to know if there are specific tests you need to take before starting it. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
