**Scenario Description:** In the bustling suburbs of Nigeria, a middle-aged woman feels a mix of anxiety and doubt about her relationship and sexual health. Recently, she overheard conversations about HIV and PrEP and is worried about what it means for her and her partner.

**You should start by asking:** "PrEP kya hai, aur kya yeh mere jese logon ke liye theek hai? Mera relationship mein bahut doubts hai."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "Kya yeh safe hai? Side effects kya hai? Aur ye kahan milta hai?" Express your concerns about how it could affect your relationship and seek clarity on its availability and effectiveness.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
