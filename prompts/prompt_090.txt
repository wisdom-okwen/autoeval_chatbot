**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling a rush of excitement mixed with a bit of anxiety about exploring your options for HIV prevention. After learning about PrEP, you can’t help but feel hopeful, but you're also wary about getting accurate information on how to access it in your area.

**You should start by asking:** "Ningependa kujua ni wapi na jinsi gani naweza kupata PrEP hapa, ni rahisi kweli?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** whether your local clinics offer it, if there are any support groups available, or what the costs might look like. Your curiosity about the actual steps to get started might lead you to inquire about side effects or how often you need to take it.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
