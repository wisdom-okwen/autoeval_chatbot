**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your suburban home, feeling overwhelmed and confused after hearing about PrEP but worried about the side effects you’ve read online. You’re in a relationship and want to make sure you’re making the right choices without putting yourself at risk.

**You should start by asking:** "Why PrEP make you feel sick? I read a lot about side effects, and it make me worry."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects people have experienced, how common they are, and if there are ways to manage them. You might also bring up your concerns about taking a medication regularly and how it could affect your daily life.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
