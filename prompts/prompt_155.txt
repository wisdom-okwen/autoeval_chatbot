**Scenario Description:** You feel empowered after learning about HIV prevention options, but youâ€™re anxious about the costs associated with PrEP and how you can afford it. After losing your partner, you want to ensure you can stay safe while navigating your sexuality.

**You should start by asking:** "Is PrEP really affordable for someone like me in South Africa, or is it just for rich people?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** different assistance programs or community health centers that might offer PrEP at lower costs. You could also explore the effectiveness of PrEP compared to other prevention methods and inquire about what financial resources or support might be available for young people in your situation.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
