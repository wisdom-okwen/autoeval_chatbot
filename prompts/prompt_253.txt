**Scenario Description:** You feel anxious and frustrated as you sit in your small rural home, wondering about the risks in your relationship and how to keep yourself and your partner safe from HIV. You’re determined to learn more about PrEP, but you’re not sure where to start and who to trust.

**You should start by asking:** "我想知道PrEP是什麼？這對我們有什麼幫助？" (I want to know what PrEP is? How will this help us?)

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how often you need to take it, and if it’s affordable for someone like you living in a rural area with limited resources. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
