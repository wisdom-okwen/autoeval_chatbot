**Scenario Description:** Feeling empowered and determined to take control of her health, the young transgender woman from rural Egypt is eager to learn about HIV prevention and PrEP before planning an international trip. Despite her high income, she struggles with the lack of resources and information in her area, which makes her feel anxious yet motivated to seek answers.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I wanna know, whatâ€™s this PrEP thing everybody talkin' about? Is it good for me if I travel?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "How I can get it? Is it safe? Do I need to do anything before I travel? I'm worried about health stuff overseas." 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
