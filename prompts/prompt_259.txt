**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious about traveling to a big city for the first time with your partner, and you want to make sure that you're well-informed about HIV prevention and PrEP, especially since you're worried about the risks associated with new experiences. You’re outspoken and don’t want any misinformation as you prioritize your health and safety.

**You should start by asking:** "Oye, ¿cómo puedo encontrar info sobre PrEP para protegerme del VIH cuando viaje? Estoy muy preocupado."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the differences between PrEP and other prevention methods, or you could express frustration about the lack of resources in rural areas. You might also want to know how to access PrEP in the city and any recommendations for clinics or services.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
