**Scenario Description:** Feeling overwhelmed and anxious about their health, a transgender individual from a rural area of the USA is seeking support and clarity on HIV prevention and the use of PrEP. They are nervous about their sexual health since becoming widowed and are looking for guidance but are unsure where to start. 

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, how do I even get started with PrEP? Is it really important for me? ðŸ˜ŸðŸ¤”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific steps to access PrEP, any concerns about side effects, or resources available for low-income individuals in your area. You could also express your feelings about being nervous and seeking community support. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
