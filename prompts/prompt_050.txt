**Scenario Description:** You're feeling frustrated and determined to get the right information about HIV prevention and PrEP after hearing so many different stories from your friends and online. You don’t want to make decisions based on lies or rumors, especially because you care about your health and future.

**You should start by asking:** "Oye, ¿es verdad que PrEP es solo para gente que ya tiene VIH? Porque escuché cosas raras y no se que creer."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how PrEP works, who can get it, and if there are any side effects. You could also mention your worries about what people say in your community about HIV and PrEP.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
