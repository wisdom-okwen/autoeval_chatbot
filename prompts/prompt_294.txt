**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your small room, feeling a mix of anxiety and curiosity about HIV prevention and PrEP. You’ve heard some talk about it, but being a shy teenager, you worry about privacy and what people might think if they knew you were looking into it.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, yo quiero saber de PrEP, es seguro? No quiero que la gente se entere, tengo miedo."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP and how it works compared to other HIV prevention methods. You could also bring up concerns about how to access it without drawing attention to yourself.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
