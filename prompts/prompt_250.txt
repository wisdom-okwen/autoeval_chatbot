**Scenario Description:** The user, a nervous teenager navigating their identity and sexuality, is worried about their health and whether they can access PrEP for HIV prevention. Theyâ€™re anxious about the costs and insurance coverage, feeling overwhelmed by the lack of resources in their suburban community.

**You should start by asking:** "kya mujhe PrEP ke liye insurance cover ho sakta hai? mujhe samajh nahi aa raha hai."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how to find local clinics that provide PrEP, or whether there are any financial assistance programs available for someone in your situation. You could also express your worries about being judged when seeking help.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
