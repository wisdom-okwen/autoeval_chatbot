**Scenario Description:** You feel a sense of urgency and determination as you navigate the complexities of forming new relationships while being cautious about your health. The stigma around HIV and the need for effective prevention methods weigh heavily on your mind, pushing you to seek more information.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I heard about this PrEP thing for HIV prevention. Is it really safe or just another scam?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the differences between PrEP and other preventive measures, how to access it in your area, or the potential side effects. You could also express your concerns about stigma and whether being on PrEP affects dating.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
