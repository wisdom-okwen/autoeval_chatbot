**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the risks of HIV, especially as a young adult navigating life in the city. You’re married but have concerns about safe practices and options like PrEP that could help you feel more secure in your sexual health.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can you tell me how to get PrEP? I don’t know where to start, and I’m really worried about this stuff."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the effectiveness of PrEP, any side effects you should be aware of, and how much it costs in your area. You might also express your frustrations about the lack of clear information regarding access to these preventive measures.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
