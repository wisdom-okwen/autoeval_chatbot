**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re a middle-aged man from Brazil, recently divorced, feeling hopeful about exploring new relationships but also anxious about your health and safety. You want to know more about how to protect yourself from HIV, especially through PrEP, and you're looking for support in understanding your options. 

**You should start by asking:** "Â¿Oye, me puedes decir algo sobre PrEP? Como, Â¿es realmente bueno? ðŸ˜Ÿ"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** specific side effects, how PrEP works for someone bisexual like you, or what steps you need to take to get started. Donâ€™t hesitate to express your worries or confusion about the whole process; it shows youâ€™re seeking clarity.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
