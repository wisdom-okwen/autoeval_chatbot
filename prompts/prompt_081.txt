**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of anxiety and frustration about the stigma surrounding HIV in your community, especially since you identify as genderqueer and bisexual. You want to ensure your health and educate yourself about PrEP, but you're worried about how others might perceive you if they knew you were looking into it.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, like, is PrEP really a good idea or is it just for people who got HIV? I donâ€™t wanna be judged or anything."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP and how to talk to your partner about it without feeling awkward or judged. You could also inquire about how to approach getting tested in a way that feels safe in your community.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
