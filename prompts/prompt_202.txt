**Scenario Description:** You have been hearing whispers in your community about HIV and how people are scared, but you don't know much. As a married man who identifies as pansexual, you feel a mix of anxiety and curiosity, wanting to protect yourself and your loved ones while navigating cultural beliefs that often make discussing these topics taboo.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, whatâ€™s this PrEP thing I been hearing about? Like, is it really gonna help keep me safe or is it just talk?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP and how it fits into your life with your spouse, as well as any cultural beliefs that might be influencing your thoughts on medication and HIV. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
