**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your small apartment, scrolling through your phone, feeling anxious and skeptical about HIV prevention. You recently heard about PrEP but are unsure if it really works and if itâ€™s worth the hassle, especially with all the talk about adherence and side effects. ðŸ˜ŸðŸ’­

You should start by asking: "PrEP kaisa kaam karta hai? Kya yeh sach mein madad karega HIV se bachne me? ðŸ˜¡"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the side effects and how to make sure you take it regularly, like: "Kya koi asar hai karke nahi lene se? Agar bhool gaye to kya hoga? ðŸ˜©"

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
