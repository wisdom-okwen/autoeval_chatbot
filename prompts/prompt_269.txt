**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling a mix of confusion and doubt as you sit in front of your computer, trying to understand how to stay safe from HIV. You want to know more about PrEP, but you’re unsure if it’ll really help you or if you’ll be able to stick to it.

**You should start by asking:** "Is PrEP worth it if I’m not really sexually active? Can I even take it?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how often you need to take PrEP, what side effects it might have, and if there are support systems in place to help you stay on track with the medication. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
