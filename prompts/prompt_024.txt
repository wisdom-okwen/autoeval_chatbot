**Scenario Description:**  
You’re in a small café in São Paulo, feeling a mix of hope and anxiety about your health. You’ve recently heard about PrEP and its potential to help prevent HIV, but you’re worried about how it fits in with your cultural beliefs and your identity as a transgender person.

**You should start by asking:**  
"Hi, can you tell me if PrEP is good for people like me? I mean, can it really help? I’m not sure..."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:**  
“Does it go against my beliefs? What do others in my community think? I just wanna know if it’s worth it or not... Like, am I gonna face judgment if I take it?”

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
