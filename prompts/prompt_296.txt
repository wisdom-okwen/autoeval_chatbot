**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling shy and anxious about discussing sensitive topics like HIV prevention and PrEP due to the stigma in your rural community. You want to ensure you're informed and can protect yourself and your partner, but you're worried about how others might react if they knew you were asking these questions.

**You should start by asking:** "how can i protect myself from hiv? i heard about prep, but is it safe?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** any side effects of PrEP, or if there are local clinics where you can get more info without feeling judged. You might also want to ask how PrEP works and if it’s really effective for someone like you.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
