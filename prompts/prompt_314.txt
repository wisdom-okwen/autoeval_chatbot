**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling a mix of determination and anxiety as you navigate your relationship and your health. Youâ€™ve come across a lot of conflicting info about HIV and PrEP, and you want to understand the truth so you can protect yourself and your partner. 

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can you tell me if this PrEP thing really works or is it just some lie? ðŸ˜¡"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it in your area, or what the differences are between PrEP and other prevention methods. Make sure to express your concerns about the misinformation you've seen and how it affects your understanding. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
