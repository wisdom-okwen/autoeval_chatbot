**Scenario Description:** You're feeling overwhelmed and anxious about accessing PrEP due to the costs involved, especially in your rural community. As a young, married transgender individual from a Zulu background, you're navigating a lot of pressures, and the thought of managing HIV prevention feels daunting.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I wanna know, how much is PrEP cost here? Like, is there any help for us in rural areas?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** local clinics offering PrEP services or if there are any community programs to help with costs. You could also bring up concerns about what it means for your health and the health of your partner, and whether insurance can help at all.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
