**Scenario Description:** Feeling a mix of determination and anxiety, you sit down to talk with a chatbot about HIV prevention and PrEP, worried about what your community might think if they find out you're seeking this information. You're aware that being open about your health choices could lead to judgment in your rural Nigerian community, and you want to navigate this carefully.

**You should start by asking:** "Oi, eu ouvi falar de PrEP, mas isso Ã© mesmo pra mim? Como a galera aqui vai encarar isso?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the possible side effects of PrEP and how to discreetly access it without drawing attention. You might also want to know how to talk to your healthcare provider about it, given your community's stigma around HIV.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
