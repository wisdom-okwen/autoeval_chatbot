**Scenario Description:** You're feeling overwhelmed and confused about your sexual health and the cultural beliefs surrounding HIV prevention. As a young transgender person in urban South Africa, you’re navigating complex feelings about PrEP, and you want to find trustworthy information amid the noise of societal expectations.

**You should start by asking:** "Salut, je comprends pas trop ce que c’est le PrEP. C’est quoi vraiment et ça marche pour moi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how PrEP fits into your life, particularly considering the cultural beliefs you face. You could also inquire about the safety and accessibility of PrEP for someone like you in your community.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
