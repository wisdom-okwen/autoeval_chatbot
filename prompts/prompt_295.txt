**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting on the porch of your rural home in Nigeria, feeling anxious about how to protect yourself and your partner from HIV. With limited access to health resources, you feel a mix of frustration and skepticism about PrEP and whether it’s even an option for you.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can I even get PrEP in my area? Like, is it free or what?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** any local clinics or organizations that provide PrEP, and question whether there are any special programs for people with low income. You might also express your worries about the side effects and whether they’re worth it given your situation. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
