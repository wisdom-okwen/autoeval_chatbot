**Scenario Description:** You feel overwhelmed and concerned about HIV prevention, especially with limited access to healthcare in your rural area. As a non-binary teenager from a low-income background, you’re eager to learn more about PrEP but also frustrated by the lack of information around you.

**You should start by asking:** "ليش ما اقدر احصل على معلومات عن PrEP والوقايه من HIV؟"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** different ways to access PrEP in your area, any local resources or support groups that could help, and what steps you could take if you feel unsure or scared about talking to a doctor.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
