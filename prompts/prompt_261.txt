**Scenario description:** You’re feeling hopeful but anxious about taking control of your health after hearing about PrEP for HIV prevention. You want to find out if it’s a safe option for you, considering your long-term health concerns and past experiences.

**You should start by asking:** "Oi, eu to ouvindo sobre PrEP, mas é seguro? Eu tenho medo de efeitos colaterais, sabe?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the effectiveness of PrEP, any potential long-term health risks, and how it might fit into your lifestyle and finances. You could also bring up your past experiences with health issues to better frame your concerns.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
