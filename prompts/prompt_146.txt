**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in a small caf√© in your suburban neighborhood, feeling shy and a bit anxious about talking to someone about HIV prevention. You know you need to learn more about PrEP, but the stigma around it makes you feel uneasy.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I don't know much about this PrEP thing, but do you think it can really help? Like, is it safe or what?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the potential side effects of PrEP or how to navigate the stigma you feel from others in your community. You could also inquire about how to talk to a healthcare provider about getting prescribed PrEP without feeling judged.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
