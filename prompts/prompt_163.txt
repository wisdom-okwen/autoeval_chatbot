**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling a mix of confusion and anxiety about the whole HIV thing. Your friends talk about it sometimes, but you’re worried about how your culture sees things, and you really want to know more about PrEP without seeming dumb or judged.

**You should start by asking:** "Salut, c'est quoi le PrEP ? C'est pour quoi faire, genre, vraiment ?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how the use of PrEP is viewed in your community, or if there are any local places where you can get more info without people judging you. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
