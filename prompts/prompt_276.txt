**Scenario Description:** You find yourself feeling anxious and doubtful as you navigate the complexities of HIV prevention. Recently divorced and trying to move forward, the uncertainty about your health and safety in relationships weighs heavily on your mind, making it hard to focus on the future. 

You should start by asking: "我应该怎么开始使用PrEP？我真的不太确定这个东西是啥，😟。"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the specific benefits of PrEP, how it works, and what you need to do to get started. You could also express your worries about side effects or the stigma around HIV prevention. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
