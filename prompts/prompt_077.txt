**Scenario Description:** After losing a partner to a health issue, you’re feeling overwhelmed and skeptical about the options for HIV prevention, especially considering your own experiences and identity. You’re looking for clear answers but also grappling with a mix of confusion and anxiety about starting PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me more about this PrEP thing? Like, is it really safe? I just lost someone and it feels all complicated now."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how it fits into your lifestyle, or any community resources available for support. You’re trying to make sense of it all among your worries and the stigma around it.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
