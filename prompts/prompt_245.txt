**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your room, feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the idea of starting PrEP for HIV prevention. You love your partner, but you're worried about the side effects you’ve heard people talk about, and you're not sure if it’s worth it.

**You should start by asking:** “Hey, what’s the real deal with PrEP side effects? Like, do they happen to everyone or what?”

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** whether there are any long-term health impacts or if there are alternatives to PrEP that might have fewer side effects. Express your concerns about how this medication might affect your life and your relationship. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
