**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious about your sexual health and want to make sure you're taking the right steps to prevent HIV. Recently divorced and navigating new relationships, you worry about the effectiveness of prevention methods and need clear, straightforward answers.

**You should start by asking:** "我想知道PrEP真的有效吗？有没有人能告诉我关于它的真实事？"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it in your area, and whether there are any costs involved since you're concerned about your income. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
