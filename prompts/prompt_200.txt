**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of anxiety and frustration as you sit at home in your rural area, worrying about the stigma surrounding HIV and how it affects people like you. You want to know more about PrEP but are unsure how to ask without facing judgment.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can i talk abt this PrEP thing? Is it really safe or just another lie? Iâ€™m scared of what people think!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** any local resources or support groups that could help you learn more about HIV prevention without feeling judged. You could also inquire about the experiences of others who are using PrEP and how they handle stigma.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
