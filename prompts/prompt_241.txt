**Scenario Description:** Feeling overwhelmed and anxious about his dating life, especially in the context of HIV prevention, a young Indian man from a rural background seeks guidance on PrEP. He’s recently divorced and is questioning how to approach future relationships safely.

**You should start by asking:** "Uh, how can I protect myself with PrEP? Like, do I really need it for dating again?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "What if my partner don’t wanna talk about it? How I make him understand? And is there like a place I can get this PrEP easily?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
