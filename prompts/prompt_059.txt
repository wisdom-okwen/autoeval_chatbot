**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a bit anxious and cautious about your health after hearing some friends talk about HIV and all these new meds. You're in a relationship and want to make sure youâ€™re both safe, but you're worried about what taking PrEP might do to your body. 

**You should start by asking:** "What is PrEP and how it work? I hear some stuff but I confused about side effects."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** any experiences others have had with side effects, the differences between PrEP and other HIV prevention methods, or if there are specific health checks you need to do before starting PrEP. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
