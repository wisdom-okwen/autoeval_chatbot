**Scenario Description:**  
You're feeling empowered but anxious about your health choices. Living in Brazil, navigating the complexities of insurance while trying to stay safe in your sexual relationships is weighing heavily on your mind. You want clear answers on HIV prevention and PrEP but are frustrated by the lack of accessible information.

**You should start by asking:**  
"Hey, what’s PrEP? Is it covered by insurance? I don’t wanna pay a lot."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:**  
"How do I get it? Like, is it hard to find? An’ what if I don’t have good insurance? How can I protect myself?" 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
