**Scenario Description:** Feeling frustrated and anxious about the stigma surrounding HIV in his rural community, a young South African male seeks guidance on HIV prevention methods, especially PrEP, wanting to ensure he can navigate his health safely without drawing unwanted attention. Heâ€™s worried about how people will perceive him if they find out heâ€™s asking questions about something so sensitive. 

**You should start by asking:** "why pple say PrEP is bad? ðŸ˜’"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** other concerns related to community perception, like whether people in your area talk about HIV openly or if there are misconceptions that you need to be aware of. You could also inquire if there's a way to get PrEP discreetly and how to approach the topic with friends or family without raising eyebrows. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
