**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling empowered and determined to take control of your sexual health, but there’s a nagging worry in the back of your mind about the effectiveness of PrEP in preventing HIV. You want clear, straightforward answers that help you understand if it's the right choice for you.

**You should start by asking:** "PrEP inachoma? Ni effective kama wanavyosema?" 

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** possible side effects, how often you need to take it, and if there are any specific considerations for someone like you living in a city. You’re looking for assurance that this isn’t just a fad but a solid option for your health.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
