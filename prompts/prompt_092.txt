**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety as you prepare to discuss HIV prevention with a chatbot. Having just learned about PrEP, you want to ensure you’re making the right choices for your health, but you're also frustrated by the lack of clear information online. 

You should start by asking: "hey, can u tell me what PrEP is and how it works? like, do I really need it or what?" 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the side effects of PrEP and how it can fit into your life as a married person. You could also express your concerns about stigma and how it affects people like you. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
