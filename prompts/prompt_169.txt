**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious and frustrated about your health and the options available to you, especially regarding HIV prevention and PrEP. Living on a tight budget as a senior, youâ€™re worried that you won't be able to access the information or resources you need. 

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me if PrEP is even something I can get? I ain't got much cash."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how to find local clinics that offer low-cost or free services, or if there are any programs specifically for seniors like yourself. You could also inquire about the side effects of PrEP and how it works, given your doubts about treatment options. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
