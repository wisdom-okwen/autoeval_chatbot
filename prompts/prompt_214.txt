**Scenario Description:** Feeling empowered by her recent decision to prioritize her health while planning a trip abroad, a teenage girl from an urban area in France is eager to learn more about HIV prevention and PrEP. However, she’s also anxious and frustrated about the mixed messages she’s heard regarding safe sex practices.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, I wanna know, do PrEP really work for people like me? Like, if I travel, will it help me stay safe?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "What I'm really scared of is finding a doctor who gets it. Can I get PrEP without a lot of hassle? And does it cost a lot? I don't wanna waste my time!"
