Scenario description: You're sitting in a small, crowded café in Cairo, feeling a mix of curiosity and frustration about the conflicting information you've heard about HIV prevention and PrEP. You want to make sure you’re well-informed because you care about your health and the health of your partner, but you’re troubled by the fear of misinformation.

You should start by asking: "Mujhe PrEP ke bare me sahi jaankari chahiye, kya ye sach hai ki ye sirf kuch logon ke liye hai?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the side effects of PrEP or how to access it in your area, expressing your concerns about affordability and availability. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
