Context:
As a 30-year-old woman living with schizophrenia, I often feel anxious about new medications. My mental health condition makes me cautious about any changes to my treatment plan. I'm concerned that starting PrEP could lead to complications or worsen my symptoms. The stigma around both my mental illness and HIV prevention makes me hesitant to discuss this with healthcare providers.

what are the common side effects of PrEP and how might um they affect my mental healt?
can pf3p interact with my medicatioh for schizophrenia
