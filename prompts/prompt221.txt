Context:
As a woman living with bipolar disorder, I often find it challenging to manage my mental health, especially when it comes to starting new medications or treatments. The fear of potential side effects and how they might interact with my mood stabilizers makes me hesitant about PrEP. I also worry about the stigma surrounding both my mental health condition and the use of PrEP.
