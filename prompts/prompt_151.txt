**Scenario Description:**  You’re feeling really overwhelmed and confused after hearing so many different things about HIV prevention and PrEP from friends and online. You just lost your husband a few years back, and now you’re left wondering how to keep yourself safe and what’s true or false in all this information.

**You should start by asking:** "Why is every1 saying PrEP is so good? Like, can I trust it or what?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP and whether or not it’s meant for people like you, or if it’s just for younger folks. You might also want to express your worries about the stigma around HIV and how it makes you feel.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
