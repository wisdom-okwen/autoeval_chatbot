**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious and worried about your health, especially when it comes to HIV prevention. Living in a rural area with limited access to healthcare makes it hard to get the right info, and you’ve been hearing mixed things about PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, like, is PrEP really gonna work for me? I’m kinda scared and don’t wanna mess this up."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the differences between PrEP and other prevention methods, or how to access PrEP in your area since you’re feeling stressed about finding reliable healthcare options in your rural setting. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
