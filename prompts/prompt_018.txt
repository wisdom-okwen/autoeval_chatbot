**Scenario Description:** You sit at home, feeling anxious and worried about your health after hearing rumors in your rural community about HIV risks. You're skeptical about the information available and need clarity on whether PrEP can really help protect you and your spouse.

**You should start by asking:** "Nina, huyu PrEP ni mzuri kweli, au ni kuchoma tu? Na ni kweli itasaidia mimi na mume wangu?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the potential side effects of PrEP, its accessibility in your area, and whether there are any local clinics that provide it for people like you who are struggling financially. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
