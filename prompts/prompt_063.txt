**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness as you prepare to learn about HIV prevention and PrEP options. You want to make informed choices but are really worried about the possible side effects. 

You should start by asking: "Hey, so what iz PrEP and can it have bad side effects like really bad ones?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the specific side effects you've heard of or how to manage them if they happen. It could be helpful to also inquire about how PrEP fits into your life in rural Kenya, especially with limited resources. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
