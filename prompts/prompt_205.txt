**Scenario Description:** You're feeling anxious and shy about your recent travels and the risks associated with HIV. You want to make sure you're informed about PrEP options, especially since youâ€™re still adjusting to being widowed and navigating your bisexuality in a new context.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, how to stop HIV? I hear this PrEP stuff but not sure what it is, can it help me?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific benefits of PrEP, how to access it, and if there are any side effects you should be worried about, especially considering your unique background and experiences. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
