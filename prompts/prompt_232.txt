Scenario Description: You're a teenager in Lagos, feeling really overwhelmed and confused about your health and safety, especially regarding HIV. You’ve heard about PrEP but are unsure whom to trust since you don’t feel comfortable with doctors and worry about how they might treat you.

You should start by asking: "Why should I trust doctors to help me with PrEP and all this HIV stuff?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about what PrEP really does, if it’s safe, and how to find a doctor who won’t judge you. You can also express your fears about talking to health professionals.

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
