**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in a bustling café in Lagos, feeling a mix of confusion and anxiety about your recent relationship decisions and the potential risks involved. You want to understand more about HIV prevention methods like PrEP, but you're particularly worried about the cost and whether it's worth it for you.

**You should start by asking:** "PrEP, how much it cost? I no wan waste money for something wey no fit help me."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** other financial options for accessing PrEP or inquire if there are community programs that could assist with costs. You may also want to express your feelings of uncertainty about the effectiveness and accessibility of these preventive methods.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
