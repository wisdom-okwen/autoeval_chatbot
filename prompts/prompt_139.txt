**Scenario Description:** You're feeling frustrated and anxious after overhearing a conversation about HIV, which brings up your worries about stigma in your rural community. Despite your high income, the fear of being judged keeps you from seeking information about PrEP, leaving you feeling isolated.

**You should start by asking:** "Why people like me, a woman, feel so shamed for asking about HIV and PrEP? Itâ€™s like nobody want to talk about it."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific side effects of PrEP or whether it's available in your area, expressing your concerns about how people in your community might react if they find out you're asking. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
