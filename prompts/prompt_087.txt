**Scenario Description:** Feeling empowered to take charge of his health, a divorced Indigenous Australian man living in an urban area of Mexico seeks to understand more about HIV prevention and PrEP. He is determined to overcome barriers related to access, given his low-income background.

**You should start by asking:** "Bonjour, je veux comprendre comment je peux accede a PrEP pour me proteger contre le VIH. Est-ce que c'est facile pour moi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific steps needed to access PrEP in your area, any potential costs involved, and whether there are local clinics that provide support for people in your situation. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
