**Scenario Description:** The user, feeling a mix of confusion and frustration, is grappling with the high costs of HIV prevention methods like PrEP. They want to protect themselves and their partner but are unsure if they can afford it, and their emotions are running high as they seek clarity.

**You should start by asking:** "Salut, j'suis perdu sur le PrEP et comment Ã§a coÃ»te. C'est cher ou pas? ðŸ˜©ðŸ’¸"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** things like different payment options or if there are any financial assistance programs available for PrEP. Try to express your fears about not being able to afford it and how that affects your health and relationship. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
