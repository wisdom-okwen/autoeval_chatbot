**Scenario Description:** You're feeling overwhelmed and anxious as you scroll through social media, bombarded with conflicting information about HIV and PrEP. You’re worried that misinformation could put your health at risk, especially as a transgender person navigating these issues.

**You should start by asking:** "What is PrEP exactly? I see so much stuff online, but I don’t trust it all."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, its availability in Egypt, or if there are specific resources you can trust for accurate information. You might also express your frustration over the lack of clear, reliable sources about HIV prevention, emphasizing how confusing everything feels right now. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
