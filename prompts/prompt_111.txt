**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety as you're starting to explore new relationships and ways to connect with others. With all the talk about safety and health, you're eager to understand how HIV prevention works, especially regarding PrEP. 

You should start by asking: "Hey, what this PrEP thing? I hear it helps but I donâ€™t really know how it works. Is it really safe for me?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the side effects of PrEP and how to access it in your city. You could also express your feelings about dating and how to keep things safe and healthy with new partners. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
