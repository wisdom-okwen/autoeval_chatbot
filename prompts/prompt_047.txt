**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling overwhelmed and confused about your sexual health, especially with all the talk about HIV and prevention methods like PrEP. With the high costs of healthcare, you’re anxious about whether you can afford the right protection for yourself.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, how much PrEP cost, for real? I heard it's pricy and I don’t got much cash."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** options for financial assistance, or if there are cheaper alternatives. You could also bring up your worries about the side effects of PrEP and if it’s really worth it.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
