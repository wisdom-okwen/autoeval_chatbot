**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in a small caf√© in your suburban neighborhood, feeling a mix of curiosity and anxiety about your sexual health. You've heard about PrEP but are worried about the cost and whether it's something you can afford, especially in your current situation.

**You should start by asking:** "bhai, PrEP ka cost kya hai? kya mujhe ye afford hoga ya nahi?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** different options for financial assistance or if there are any local programs that provide PrEP at a lower cost. You could also inquire about the effectiveness of PrEP and whether it really works for people in your situation.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
