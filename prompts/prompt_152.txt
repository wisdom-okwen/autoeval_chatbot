**Scenario description:** You're sitting in your room, scrolling through social media, and feeling a mix of hope and confusion about your relationship life. You've been hearing more about HIV and PrEP lately, and while you want to protect yourself and your partners, you're not sure where to start. 

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, Â¿puedo preguntar sobre PrEP? He escuchado cosas, pero no entiendo bien."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** how effective PrEP is, who can take it, and any side effects. You might also want to express how important it is for you to have safe relationships and how you're feeling a bit lost about it all. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
