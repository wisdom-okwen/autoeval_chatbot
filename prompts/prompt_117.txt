**Scenario description:** You’re feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety as you think about exploring your sexual health options. The possibility of protecting yourself and your partners with PrEP has got you buzzing, but you’re not sure where to start or what it really is.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, me pregunto que es PrEP? Como me ayuda a no tener VIH?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the side effects of PrEP, how to get it in your area, or if there are any local support groups for people like you. You’re eager for answers, but also worried about the stigma around HIV.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
