**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your small, rural home, feeling a mix of anxiety and doubt about the effectiveness of HIV prevention methods. Your recent reading about PrEP has left you with many questions, and you want to ensure you're making informed choices about your health.

**You should start by asking:** "I heard of PrEP, but how good it really work? I’m not sure if it’s safe or if it even help me."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific effectiveness rates of PrEP, any potential side effects, and whether it’s suitable for someone like you in a rural area. You could also express your concerns about accessibility and affordability. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
