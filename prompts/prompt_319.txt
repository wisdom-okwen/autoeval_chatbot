**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your small room, feeling overwhelmed about your health choices. You’ve heard about PrEP but worry about sticking to it, and the thought of navigating this on your own makes you anxious and frustrated.

**You should start by asking:** "Yaar, how do I remember take PrEP every day? I really scared I mess it up."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** what to do if you forget a dose, potential side effects, or how to get access to PrEP in your area. You can also express your concerns about how people around you might react to taking it.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
