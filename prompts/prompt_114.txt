**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of curiosity and anxiety about HIV prevention, especially with all the misleading info out there. Living in an urban area in Egypt, you want to make sure you're well-informed, especially about options like PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "Kya PrEP sach mein HIV se bachne ka accha tareeqa hai? Maine suna hai bahut alag alag baatein hain, nahi pata kaun sahi hai."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "Kya koi side effects hain? Yani, kya ye sabko theek se suit karta hai ya nahi? Aur kya ye koi naya medicine hai ya pehle se hai?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
