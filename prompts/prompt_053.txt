**Scenario Description:** You're feeling frustrated and anxious about how to talk to your partner about HIV prevention. You want to make sure you're both safe, especially since you don't have much experience with these kinds of discussions, and it's really important to you.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so I heard about this PrEP thing, is that like really important or what? How do I even bring this up with my partner?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the different ways PrEP works, how effective it is, and if you need to worry about anything specific in your relationship. You could also mention your concerns about managing the conversation, like how to make it less awkward.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
