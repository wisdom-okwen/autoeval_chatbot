Scenario Description: You’re feeling a mix of curiosity and concern as you sit in your trendy urban apartment, wondering about the costs involved with PrEP. You’ve heard about it but want to make sure it fits into your budget before making any decisions.

You should start by asking: "Niaje, PrEP ni ghali sana? Na kama ni, kuna njia za kupunguza bei?"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about different payment options or if there are programs that help with the costs of PrEP. You could also inquire about how effective it is compared to other prevention methods.

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
