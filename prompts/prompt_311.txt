**Scenario Description:** You're feeling pretty anxious about your health and the whole HIV thing. The idea of talking to a doctor makes you nervous, especially when it comes to finding out about PrEP and what it can do for you, so you’re looking for info but not sure who to trust. 

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so I wanna kno more about dis PrEP thing, but like how do I kno if doctors ain't just tryna sell me stuff?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** your concerns over the reliability of the information you're getting, like, “Do you think all these docs really care about us, or just money?” or “How do I find a doc I can trust with dis stuff?” 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
