**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your living room, feeling a mix of confusion and frustration about the risks of HIV and how to protect yourself. The thought of discussing such personal matters makes you anxious, especially regarding privacy, but you know you need to get some answers about PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "how can I keep my info safe when I ask about PrEP? like will they tell my doctor or something?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** specific concerns regarding confidentiality, like, "will I have to give my name or ID?" or "do they keep records that can be seen by others?" Your emotional state is making you wary, so keep focusing on ways to ensure your privacy is respected.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
