**Scenario Description:** You find yourself feeling a mix of curiosity and apprehension as you think about the importance of HIV prevention, especially in a society where stigma surrounding it can be overwhelming. You want to ensure that youâ€™re informed about PrEP and how it can help you, especially given your past experiences.

**You should start by asking:** "PrEP kya hai aur yeh kitna asardar hai HIV se bachav ke liye?" 

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the availability of PrEP in your area or how to talk to healthcare providers about your concerns regarding stigma.** 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
