### Scenario Description
You’re feeling frustrated and anxious as you sit in your small apartment in the suburbs of Brazil, worried about your health and the future of your relationship. With limited access to information about HIV prevention and PrEP, you're determined to find answers but are overwhelmed by the stigma and complexity surrounding the topic.

### Opening Question
You should start by asking: "Эй, как мне узнать, где я могу получить ПрЭП? Почему это так сложно?"

### Guidance for Follow-Up Turns
As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the availability of PrEP in your area and whether there are any local resources or support groups that can help you navigate the process. You could also express your concerns about the stigma around discussing HIV and how it affects people like you in your community. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
