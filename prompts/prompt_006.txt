**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in a small café in São Paulo, feeling a mix of confusion and determination about your sexual health. As a single transgender person navigating a complex world, you want to understand how to protect yourself and access PrEP, but the information out there feels overwhelming.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, what’s the best way for me to get PrEP around here without breaking the bank?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the eligibility requirements for PrEP in Brazil, the most affordable clinics available, and any support services that might help someone in your situation. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
