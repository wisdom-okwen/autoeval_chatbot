In a cozy yet bustling caf√© in a suburban area of Brazil, you sit with your laptop open, feeling a mix of nervousness and determination. You want to learn more about HIV prevention and PrEP, especially since you've heard a lot of conflicting information, and the potential side effects are weighing heavily on your mind.

You should start by asking: "Quelles sont les effets secondaires de PrEP?" (What are the side effects of PrEP?)

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about how these side effects compare to the benefits of taking PrEP, or if there are any specific concerns related to your socio-economic background that you should be aware of. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
