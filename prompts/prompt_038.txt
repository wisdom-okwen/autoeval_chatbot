**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in a café in your suburban neighborhood, feeling anxious about the stigma around HIV in your community. You're worried about how people might react if they find out you're considering PrEP for protection.

**You should start by asking:** "Eh, can u tell me if PrEP really works? Like, what will my neighbors think if they find out I'm on it?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the side effects of PrEP, how to talk to your friends about it, or if there are local resources that can help you navigate the community perception. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
