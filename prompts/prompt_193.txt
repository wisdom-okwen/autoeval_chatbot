**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling determined to take control of your sexual health after learning about PrEP, but you’re worried about how to stick to the regimen. You want answers but feel a bit overwhelmed and unsure about where to start.

**You should start by asking:** "Nina, PrEP inafanyaje kazi na je, ni rahisi kuifata?" (Hey, how does PrEP work and is it easy to stick to?)

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how to deal with any side effects, what resources are available for people in rural areas, or if there are any support groups that can help with adherence. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
