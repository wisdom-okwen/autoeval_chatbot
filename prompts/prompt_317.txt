**Scenario Description:** You're feeling a mix of anxiety and frustration about talking openly regarding HIV prevention, especially as a pansexual Indigenous person living in a rural area. The fear of stigma weighs heavily on you, making this conversation feel like a significant step.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me how PrEP really works? I feel like people just wanna judge me for askin."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the side effects of PrEP, how accessible it is in your area, or if there are specific resources for Indigenous communities. You could express your concerns about the stigma and how it affects your decision-making.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
