Context:
As a 34-year-old woman living with multiple sclerosis, I often feel overwhelmed by the prospect of managing my health. The idea of starting PrEP brings up fear about possible interactions with my MS medications and worries about how it may affect my overall well-being. I want to be proactive about my sexual health but feel anxious about the implications for my condition. Stigma surrounding both PrEP and MS makes it hard to talk openly about my concerns, and I am looking for clear, trustworthy information.
