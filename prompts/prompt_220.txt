**Scenario Description:** The user, a young transgender person from Mexico, is buzzing with excitement about the potential for better health and safety through HIV prevention, especially given their asexuality. However, they are also anxious about how insurance might cover treatments like PrEP and feel a bit overwhelmed navigating the healthcare system.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, does insurance cover this PrEP stuff? I'm kinda worried about that."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "What if I donâ€™t have insurance? Is there help for people like me? And can I take PrEP even if I'm not, ya know, sexually active? Just wanna be safe." 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
