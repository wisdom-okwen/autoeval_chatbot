**Scenario Description:** The user, a confused and anxious teenager from Egypt, is feeling overwhelmed about her health and the trustworthiness of medical advice surrounding HIV prevention and PrEP. She is in a relationship and is worried about whether she can rely on her doctor’s information regarding sexual health.

**You should start by asking:** "我不太明白这个PrEP的事，医生真的能信吗？😩💔"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the effectiveness of PrEP, how it works, and whether there are any side effects. You could also express your worries about discussing this topic with your doctor and if there are other resources to trust. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
