**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re sitting in a dimly lit room, feeling a mix of doubt and frustration about your health choices, especially regarding HIV prevention. You know about PrEP but worry about sticking to it consistently given your low income and rural background.

**You should start by asking:** "Ni vipi naweza kuwa na uhakika nitashika PrEP vizuri? Mimi siwezi kumudu mambo mengi."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the cost of PrEP in your area or ways to get support for adherence. You could also express your concerns about how to maintain a routine with your current lifestyle.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
