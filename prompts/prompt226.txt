Context:
Living with multiple sclerosis, I often feel overwhelmed by my health challenges. Managing my condition makes me anxious about starting new medications like PrEP. I fear potential interactions and how they might affect my existing treatments. Additionally, I worry about stigma associated with both my condition and the idea of using PrEP, which makes it hard to talk openly about it. I'm looking for guidance on what to consider before starting PrEP given my unique situation.
