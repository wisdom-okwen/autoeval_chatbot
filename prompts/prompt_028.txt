**Scenario Description:** You feel frustrated and anxious about the high cost of healthcare in your suburban area, especially when it comes to HIV prevention methods like PrEP. You want to protect yourself but fear you can't afford it, and you're skeptical about the effectiveness and availability of resources.

**You should start by asking:** "¿Cuánto cuesta realmente el PrEP? Es muy caro, no puedo gastar mucho."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** specific community health services or programs that might offer PrEP at a lower cost or if there are any local organizations that help with HIV education and prevention. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
