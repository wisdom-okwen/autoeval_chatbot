**Scenario Description:** You just learned about PrEP for HIV prevention and are really excited but worried about what your friends and community back home in Brazil will think if they find out you're considering it. You feel a mix of hope and anxiety as you want to protect yourself but also fear the stigma around it.

**You should start by asking:** "我想知道PrEP到底是什麼？我朋友會怎麼想？"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how to access PrEP in your area, what the side effects might be, or if there are any community resources to help people understand PrEP better. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
