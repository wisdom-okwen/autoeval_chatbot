In this scenario, you are feeling confused about your options for HIV prevention, specifically regarding PrEP, and you are motivated to understand how this might relate to your health insurance coverage. You want clear and direct answers to help navigate this complex situation.

You should start by asking: "¿Cómo puedo saber si PrEP está cubierto por mi seguro de salud aquí en Nigeria?" 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the eligibility requirements for PrEP, potential side effects, and how to discuss these options with your healthcare provider. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
