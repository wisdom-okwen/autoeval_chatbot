In a suburban caf√© in Kenya, a middle-aged genderqueer individual sits with a close friend, contemplating the stigma surrounding HIV prevention in their community. Feeling curious yet anxious about how their identity might affect their health choices, they decide to seek more information about PrEP discreetly.

You should start by asking: "What are some common misconceptions about PrEP that people in my community might have?" 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the availability of PrEP in your area or how to approach the topic of HIV prevention with your partner, considering your unique background and relationship dynamics. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
