**Scenario Description:** You feel nervous as you sit down to chat with the bot. Living in a rural area, you're worried about the stigma around HIV and PrEP, especially as a genderqueer person. You want to know how to protect yourself without facing judgment from your community. 

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, kwaheri, nisaidie, je, PrEP ni mzuri kwa watu kama mimi? ðŸ˜Ÿ"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** whether there are local clinics that are discreet, or how to talk to your partner about getting on PrEP without feeling ashamed. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
