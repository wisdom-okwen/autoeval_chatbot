**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious and frustrated after hearing conflicting information about HIV prevention and PrEP from friends and online sources. You want to ensure you get accurate information to protect yourself and your partners but don’t know where to start.

**You should start by asking:** "Nini maana ya PrEP? Nime sikia mambo tofauti, sina uhakika kama ni salama au la."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the effectiveness of PrEP, how to access it in your urban area, and any potential side effects you should be aware of. You may also want to clarify common myths you've heard regarding HIV transmission and prevention.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
