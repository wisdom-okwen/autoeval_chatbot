**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in your small home, feeling nervous and shy about reaching out for information on HIV prevention and PrEP. As a transgender individual, you’ve faced many challenges, and you're particularly worried about the side effects of the medication that could affect your health and everyday life.

**You should start by asking:** "I dunno much 'bout this PrEP stuff, but... like, do it really have bad side effects? Like, what kinda things can happen?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "Is it safe for someone like me, ya know? I’m just worried I might end up feelin' worse instead of better. Also, how can I talk to my doc about this without feelin' awkward?"

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
