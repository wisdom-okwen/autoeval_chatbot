**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your small rural home, feeling a rush of excitement about an upcoming trip to a nearby city for a gay pride event. However, mixed with your excitement is a nagging worry about staying safe and healthy, especially regarding HIV prevention and whether you should be looking into PrEP. 

**You should start by asking:** "Oye, what’s the deal with this PrEP thing? Do I really need it if I’m travelin’ and stuff?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the effectiveness of PrEP, any potential side effects, how to access it on a low income, or if there are specific resources for LGBTQ+ travelers like you. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
