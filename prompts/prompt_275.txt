**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling anxious and a bit confused about HIV prevention, especially regarding the costs of PrEP. With so much information out there, you just want to make sure you're making the right choices for your health without breaking the bank. 

You should start by asking: "How much does PrEP cost? Like, is it super expensive? ðŸ˜ŸðŸ’¸"

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the availability of PrEP in your area or if there are any financial assistance programs that can help you afford it. You could also express your worries about going to a clinic and how that might affect your privacy. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
