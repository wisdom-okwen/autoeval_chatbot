In a suburban setting in China, a middle-aged married woman feels uncertain about her health and the dynamics of her relationships, particularly regarding HIV prevention and the options available to her, like PrEP. She is hesitant to discuss these topics openly, fearing judgment and misunderstanding.

You should start by asking: "Quelles sont les options disponibles pour la pr√©vention du VIH, comme le PrEP, et comment cela pourrait-il affecter ma relation?" 

As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the effectiveness of PrEP in preventing HIV, its potential side effects, and how to approach the topic with your partner in a sensitive manner. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
