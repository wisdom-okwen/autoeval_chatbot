**Scenario Description:** You feel overwhelmed by the cultural beliefs surrounding sexual health in your community, and you're worried about how they affect your relationship. You're motivated to learn about HIV prevention and PrEP, but you’re anxious about how to approach the topic without facing judgment.

**You should start by asking:** "hey, can u tell me why people like, freak out about PrEP in my culture? like, isn’t it just a way to stay safe?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific misconceptions you’ve heard from friends or family, such as "Why do people think PrEP is just for certain types of people? Don’t we all need to care about this stuff?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
