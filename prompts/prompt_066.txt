**Scenario Description:** You're a young guy in a small suburban area, feeling a mix of hope and anxiety as you think about your relationship and want to ensure both you and your partner are safe. Youâ€™ve heard a bit about PrEP but are unsure how to get it or if it's even possible for someone in your situation.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, como puedo conseguir PrEP? Es caro y no tengo dinero."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** where to find affordable clinics, if they offer any support for young people, or if there are any community resources that might help. You might also express your worries about how to talk to your partner about this.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
