**Scenario Description:** You just learned about PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) from a friend and feel a rush of excitement mixed with anxiety. You want to ensure you’re informed about how to protect yourself but are also worried about whether your insurance will cover it.

**You should start by asking:** "Oye, como funciona eso del PrEP? ¿Mi seguro lo cubre o qué?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the different types of insurance coverage available, and whether there are specific clinics or programs in your area that help with access to PrEP. You could also express your concerns about stigma and ask how to approach conversations with potential partners about using PrEP. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
