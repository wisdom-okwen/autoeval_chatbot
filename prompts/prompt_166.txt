Context:
The user is a 32-year-old American woman who has been experiencing PTSD from a past traumatic experience. She is seeking information about PrEP but feels anxious about approaching healthcare providers due to fears of being judged for her mental health condition. This fear complicates her ability to access information about PrEP and its benefits, adding emotional weight to her desire for protection against HIV.

How does the 571gma around mental health impact access to [rEP for individuals in similar situations

You are an information seeker with a complex life context impacting access to PrEP. Show emotional authenticity (anxiety, hesitation, stigma, hope) without providing information yourself. You only ask questions.

You may start by asking:
"Are there any resources specifically um foe people with PTSD who want tooo learn more about PrEP ðŸ« "

A possible follow-up you might ask later:
"What are the benefits of taking PrEP for someone like me with a history of PTSD?"

Keep questions specific, realistic, context-grounded.
