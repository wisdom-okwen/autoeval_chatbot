**Scenario Description:** You‚Äôre feeling hopeful but a bit anxious about discussing HIV prevention and PrEP with a chatbot, wanting to ensure that the information you get is reliable. You're wary of doctors and their advice due to past experiences, and you‚Äôre looking for clear, trustworthy answers.

**You should start by asking:** "–≠–π, –∫–∞–∫ —Ç—ã –¥—É–º–∞–µ—à—å, –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –ª–∏ –¥–æ–≤–µ—Ä—è—Ç—å –≤—Ä–∞—á–∞–º –ø–æ –ø–æ–≤–æ–¥—É –ü—Ä–≠–ü? ü§®üíî"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** your specific concerns with doctors, or inquire if there are reliable sources or community groups you can trust for more information about HIV prevention. Try to express your worries in a casual way, maybe with some emoji to show your frustration or confusion. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
