**Scenario Description:** You’re a middle-aged woman living in rural Egypt, recently widowed, and feeling cautious about your sexual health. The loss of your partner has made you more aware of the risks involved in new relationships, and you're looking for information on how to protect yourself from HIV, particularly regarding PrEP.

**You should start by asking:** "I just heard about this PrEP thing, but like, how does it really work and am I supposed to take it all the time?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "I’m worried if it’s gonna mess with my other health stuff or how I can get it here. Like, do I even need a doctor for this? And does it cost a ton?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
