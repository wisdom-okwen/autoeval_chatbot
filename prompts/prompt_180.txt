**Scenario Description:** You're sitting on a rickety chair outside your home in rural Nigeria, feeling a mix of anxiety and skepticism about your sexual health. You’ve heard some talk about PrEP but are worried about the side effects, and you’re eager to get the right information without the fluff.

**You should start by asking:** "So, like, what are the real side effects of PrEP? I heard some scary stuff but it’s hard to know what’s true."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how long people usually stay on PrEP before they notice any side effects, or if there are other alternatives that might have less risk. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
