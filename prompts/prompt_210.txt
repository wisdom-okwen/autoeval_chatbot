**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling overwhelmed with the thought of traveling abroad soon, and you’re anxious about ensuring your health and safety, especially regarding HIV prevention. You want clear information about PrEP, but you’re struggling to find reliable sources and feeling frustrated.

**You should start by asking:** "Can I get info on what PrEP is and if it’s good for me when I travel? Like, how does it work and do I need a prescription or somthing?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it while traveling, and whether there are specific guidelines you should follow as a transgender person. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
