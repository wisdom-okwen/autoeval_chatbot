**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling a mix of hope and anxiety as you think about your health and future relationships. Living in a rural area, you’re eager to learn about the best ways to protect yourself from HIV, especially given your bisexual orientation, and you're curious about PrEP but have a lot of questions swimming around in your head.

**You should start by asking:** "bhai, PrEP kya hai, aur kya yeh sach mei safe hai? main kafi chinta kar raha hoon long-term safety ke liye."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how to access PrEP in your area, what kind of side effects it might have, and whether there are any specific risks you should be aware of as someone who's sexually active with different partners. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
