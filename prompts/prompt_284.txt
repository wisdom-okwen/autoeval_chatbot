**Scenario Description:** You're sitting at your computer, feeling a mix of anxiety and curiosity about your health. Having recently learned about PrEP, you're unsure about its long-term safety and how it might affect your life moving forward, especially given your experiences and background.

**You should start by asking:** "¿Esto de PrEP es seguro? No quiero hacerme daño a largo plazo, y no sé nada de esto. Ayudame."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** any potential side effects of PrEP or if there are any religious concerns regarding its use. You could also inquire about how it’s perceived within your community, given your unique background. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
