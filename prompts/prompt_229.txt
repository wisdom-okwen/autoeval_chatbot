**Scenario Description:** You're sitting in your room scrolling through your phone, feeling empowered after doing some research on HIV prevention and PrEP. You're eager to learn more about how to protect yourself and others, but you also feel a bit overwhelmed and frustrated about not having enough clear info.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, can u tell me if PrEP is really good for somebody like me? Like, Iâ€™m a teenager and stuff, and I just wanna make sure I'm safe when I travel."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific benefits of PrEP for someone who's asexual, or how to access it without breaking the bank. You could also express your concerns about stigma or being judged and ask if there are support resources available for young people in your situation.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
