**Scenario Description:** As a young transgender individual from a rural area in Mexico, youâ€™ve just lost your partner and are feeling overwhelmed by grief and uncertainty. You want to know more about HIV prevention options like PrEP, but you're worried about the costs and whether these treatments are accessible to someone like you.

**You should start by asking:** "How much PrEP cost? Is there any help for people like me who no have much money?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** different ways to access PrEP, like whether there are programs that help cover the costs or if there are clinics in your area that offer it for free or at a lower rate. You might also want to inquire about what the process is like for getting a prescription and if there are any eligibility criteria you need to meet. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
