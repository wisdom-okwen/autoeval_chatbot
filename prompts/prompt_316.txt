**Scenario Description:** You feel a knot in your stomach as you think about your relationships and the worries that swirl around you regarding HIV prevention. Confused and unsure, you want to understand how PrEP might fit into your life, especially with all the talk about sexual health lately.

**You should start by asking:** "Why I need this PrEP thing? Do I need it if I not have sex?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** how PrEP works and if it can help people like you who are not sexually active but still worry about HIV. You might also want to know what steps you gotta take to get it and if itâ€™s affordable for someone in your situation.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
