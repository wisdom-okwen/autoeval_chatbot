**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling anxious and overwhelmed about your sexual health and the idea of starting PrEP, especially with all the info out there. As a genderqueer teen in Paris, you want to make sure you’re taking the right steps for prevention, but you're not sure how to stick with it.

**You should start by asking:** "How do I even know if PrEP is right for me? Like, what if I forget to take it sometimes?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** other ways to stay on track with taking PrEP, or what happens if you miss doses. You might also want to express your fears about the side effects or ask if there are support groups for people like you who are starting this journey. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
