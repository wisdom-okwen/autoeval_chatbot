**Scenario Description:** You're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed as you sit in a local caf√©, scrolling through your phone for information about HIV prevention. The fear of the unknown and doubts about the effectiveness of PrEP have you on edge, and you need straight answers but feel lost in the jargon.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, so like, is PrEP really gonna work for me? I just don't get how it helps, ya know?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP and whether it's accessible in Egypt, expressing your doubts about the healthcare system. You could also bring up any concerns about stigma or how people might react to you asking for it.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
