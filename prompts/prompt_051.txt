**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re feeling a mix of curiosity and skepticism as you sit in your urban apartment. Having recently heard about PrEP for HIV prevention, you're eager to learn more but also worried about finding reliable information and whether doctors can be trusted to give you the right advice.

**You should start by asking:** "Why should I trust doctors about PrEP? They say it helps but can I believe them?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** "How do I know if PrEP is good for me? Is there side effects? And what if my doctor don't know much?" 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
