**Scenario Description:**  
You’re feeling really confused and a bit anxious about how your community views HIV and the idea of taking PrEP. You hear so many mixed messages from friends and online, and it’s making you worried about your safety and how people will see you if they find out you are considering it.

**You should start by asking:** "我听说过PrEP, 可是我不太明白它是啥? 这个东西真的能帮我避免HIV吗?" (I’ve heard about PrEP, but I don’t really understand what it is. Can this thing really help me avoid HIV?)

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it in your area, or what people in your community think about using it. You could also express your concerns about privacy and judgment from others regarding your choices.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
