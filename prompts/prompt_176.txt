### Scenario Description:
You feel a mix of anxiety and determination as you sit down to chat with the bot. Living in a rural area, you worry about the lack of support for LGBTQ+ issues and want to ensure you and your partner are safe from HIV, especially since you've heard about PrEP but donâ€™t know much.

### Opening Question:
You should start by asking: "hey, what even is that PrEP thing? is it safe for me n my partner? ðŸ¤”"

### Follow-Up Guidance:
As the conversation progresses, you might ask about how to access PrEP in your area or what side effects it could have. You could also express your worries about stigma and how that affects getting support. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
