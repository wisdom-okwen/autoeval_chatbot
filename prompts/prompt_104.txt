**Scenario Description:** You’re sitting in a quiet corner of your rural home, feeling hopeful about building new connections after a recent breakup. You’ve been reading about HIV and PrEP, and you want to make sure you’re safe before diving back into the dating scene.

**You should start by asking:** "Ay, so like, what’s this PrEP thing? Is it really safe? Like, I heard it helps but I wanna know more!"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how to get it in rural areas, or the difference between PrEP and other methods of protection. You’re eager to understand how this could impact your relationships moving forward.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
