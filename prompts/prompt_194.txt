**Scenario Description:** You're feeling frustrated and anxious about the stigma surrounding HIV in your community. As a genderqueer person in Egypt, you want to learn more about PrEP for your own peace of mind and to help others who are struggling with cultural beliefs that make discussing HIV difficult. 

**You should start by asking:** "Ndio, lakini kwanini watu wanatazama HIV kama ni aibu? Na Je, PrEP inasaidia vipi? ðŸ¤”"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about:** the specific side effects of PrEP, how to access it in your area, or how to address family members' misconceptions about HIV and prevention. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
