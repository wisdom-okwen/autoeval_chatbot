**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re sitting at home feeling worried about your health and future. You just heard about PrEP but have tons of questions about it, and youâ€™re feeling shy about asking anyone face-to-face. You want to make sure youâ€™re safe in your relationship but donâ€™t know where to start. 

**Opening Question:** You should start by asking: "Ø§ÙŠÙ‡ Ù‡Ùˆ PrEP Ø¯Ù‡ ÙˆØ§Ø²Ø§ÙŠ Ù…Ù…ÙƒÙ† ÙŠØ­Ù…ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø§Ø³ Ø²ÙŠÙŠØŸ ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­"

**Follow-up Guidance:** As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the side effects or whether PrEP is really safe for long-term use. You could also express your worries about how others might react to you wanting to use it. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
