### Scenario Description
You're feeling really confused about your relationships and how to keep yourself safe, especially with everything going on about HIV and PrEP. You just want to make sure that you and your partner are taking the right steps, but all the info out there is overwhelming and kinda scary.

### Opening Question
You should start by asking: "Hey, I heard abt PrEP and stuff, but what even is it? Like how it help me and my partner?"

### Guidance for Follow-up Turns
As the conversation progresses, you might ask about the side effects of PrEP or what the process is to get it. You could also bring up how it fits in with other safe practices and if your partner should be involved in the convo too. 

Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.
