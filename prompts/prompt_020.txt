**Scenario Description:** The user, feeling a mix of anxiety and shyness, is eager to learn about HIV prevention methods but is particularly worried about the possible side effects of PrEP. They want to be informed but feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the topic.

**You should start by asking:** "Hola, yo quiero saber si PrEP tiene efectos secundarios, es peligroso o no?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the experiences of others who have taken PrEP, questions about the duration of any side effects, or how to manage any discomfort that might arise while using it. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
