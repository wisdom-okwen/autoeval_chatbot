**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling overwhelmed about your upcoming travel plans and the need to stay safe regarding HIV. As a bisexual, non-binary teenager from a low-income background, you’re anxious about how to access PrEP while away, and you want to make sure you’re informed before you go.

**You should start by asking:** "Hey, like, can I really get PrEP while I'm traveling? I don't even know where to start or if I can afford it."

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the specific places you’re traveling to and whether there are local clinics or resources to get PrEP. You might also want to inquire about the costs and if any assistance programs are available for someone like you. 

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
