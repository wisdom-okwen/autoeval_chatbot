**Scenario Description:** Youâ€™re sitting in your suburban home feeling anxious and unsure about your health choices. You've heard about PrEP and want to know more, especially about any side effects that might worry you.

**You should start by asking:** "Im just really worried about all these side effects I keep hearing about, like what are they really, ya know?"

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the effectiveness of PrEP and if there are specific studies or experiences from others that could ease your concerns. You could also express your fears about how these side effects could affect your daily life or mental well-being.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
