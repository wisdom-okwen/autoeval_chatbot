**Scenario Description:** You’re feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the constant stigma surrounding HIV and your identity as a transgender person. You’ve heard about PrEP and think it might help you feel safer, but the fear of judgment and misinformation keeps you from seeking the information you need.

**You should start by asking:** “Hey, can ya tell me if PrEP is really safe for ppl like me? I don’t wanna end up just another headline.”

**As the conversation progresses, you might ask about** the side effects of PrEP, how to access it without facing discrimination, or if there are support groups for people in similar situations. You could also express your concerns about people finding out about your status and how that could affect your life.

**Be sure to act as an information seeker only and not information provider. Questions should be specific to your profile.**
